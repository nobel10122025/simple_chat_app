Kapoor\\n\\n\\x0cPreface\\n\\nShri   Mantreswara\\'s   \\'Phaladeeplka\\'   holds   a   most   distinguished   position \\n\\namongst   the   great   ancient   astrological   classics   alongwith   Brihat   Parasara   Hora \\n\\nSastra, Varahmihira\\'s Brihat Jataka and Vaidya Natha\\'s Jataka Parijata. It deals in a \\n\\nmost   comprehensive   and   authoritative   manner   with   almost   all   the   astrological \\n\\naspects of human life. There can be said to be nothing that this great work has \\n\\nomitted from its purview.\\n\\nSome of the important subjects dealt with in a lucid manner in the book are: \\n\\ndescription   and   characteristic   features   of   the   various   signs,   planets   and   bhavas \\n\\n(houses), the various kinds of strengths of planets and their awasthas with their \\n\\neffects, sources of livelihood, yogas or planetary combinations leading to affluence \\n\\nand poverty, effects of planets in different houses, effects of different Ascendants, \\n\\nFemale horoscopy, matters relating to matrimony and progeny determination of \\n\\nlongevity,   judgment   of   houses,   various   kinds   of   Dasas   and   their   effects, \\n\\nAshtakavarga and its importance in the judging of effects of transit of planets, \\n\\ntransit   effects   of   planets   and   constellations,   and   description   and   influence   of \\n\\nupagrahas.\\n\\nThe author of this book Shri Mantreswara is believed to have lived in the \\n\\n13th century when this valuable work must have been compiled. It is said that he \\n\\nbelonged to a family of Namboodari Brahmins and he was born in tirinevelley \\n\\nDistrict of the erstwhile Madras Presidency (now known as Tamil Nadu). He was a \\n\\ndevotee   of   Sukuntlambki   Devi.  As   a   young   man   his   name   was   Markandeya \\n\\nBhattadri. To attain knowledge he is said to have travelled to far off places like \\n\\nBadrika Ashram in Himalayas and Mithila Pradesh - By sheer dint of hard work \\n\\nand   devotion,   he   became   well   versed   in   the   Vedanta   philosophy   and   in   the \\n\\nknowledge   of   other   sastras,   and   by   severe   observance   of   fast,   penance   and \\n\\nmeditation, he became gifted with divine knowledge and assumed the name of \\n\\nMantreswara. His knowledge of Astrology was profound and the reference in his \\n\\nbook to Parasara, Varahamihira and other learned astrologers indicates that he had \\n\\n2\\n\\n\\x0cmade a deep study of all the ancient astrological works existing in his time.\\n\\nThe   present   book   is   so   instructive   that   beginners   as   well   as   advanced \\n\\nstudents of Astrology can obtain very useful guidance from its study.\\n\\nNew Delhi\\n\\nG.S.

May the Supreme Divine Light (the Sun) who once above the horizon \\n\\nremains on end in view for six months (solar) to the pole dwelling Celestials, for \\n\\nhalf a month (Lunar) to the Moon dwelling manes and for 12 hours (entire day \\n\\ntime) to the earth dwelling mortals and some times changes his direction to the \\n\\nnorth   (Uttarayan)   and   some-times   to   the   south   (Dakshinayan),   bless   us   with \\n\\nunlimited prosperity, good luck, splendor and beatitude.\\n\\n2.   I,   the   astrologer   Mantreswara,   first   offer   my   respectful   obeisance   to \\n\\nSaraswati,   the   Goddess   of   speech   and   learning,   to   my   family   deity,   to   my \\n\\npreceptors, to the nine planets (the Sun, the Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, \\n\\nSaturn, Rahu and Ketu) to Lord Ganesha and Lord Shiva who bestow knowledge \\n\\nof the past, present and. future, and then give here for the benefit of astrologers a \\n\\nlucid version in a simple manner of the teachings of sages Atri and Parasara.\\n\\n3. The first thing is to ascertain the exact time of birth of the native minutely \\n\\nin Ghatikas, Vighatikas etc., on the basis of tool measurement or by the gnomonic \\n\\nshadow and other apparatus. Then the positions of the planets (longitude) in Rasi \\n\\n(sign), amsa (degrees), Kala (minutes), and Vikala should be worked out by actual \\n\\nobservation and mathematical  instruments. The assessment of results should be \\n\\nmade   thereafter   by   taking   into   account   the   longitudes   of   the   various   houses \\n\\n(Bhavaspast) and the strength of the houses and the planets.\\n\\n4. Assuming that the horoscope represents the Kalapurusha, then the parts of \\n\\nthe body beginning with the Ascendant (Lagna) will be as under:\\n\\nFirst house (Lagna-Ascendant)\\n\\n— the head\\n\\nSecond house\\n\\n— the face\\n\\n10\\n\\n\\x0cThird house\\n\\nFourth house\\n\\nFifth house\\n\\nSixth house\\n\\nSeventh house\\n\\nEighth house\\n\\nNinth house\\n\\nTenth house\\n\\nEleventh house\\n\\nTwelfth house\\n\\n— the breast\\n\\n— the heart\\n\\n— the belly\\n\\n— the waist\\n\\n— the groins\\n\\n— the private parts (Sexual organs)\\n\\n— the two thighs\\n\\n— the two knees\\n\\n— the two calves\\n\\n— the two feet\\n\\nThe end portions of the signs Cancer, Scorpio and Pisces are known as Rasi-\\n\\nSandhisj. There are other learneds who apply this term to the end portions of all \\n\\nsigns.\\n\\nNotes — The house which is occupied or aspected by benefits or whose lord \\n\\nis bestowed with strength, the part of the body represented by that house will be \\n\\nstrong and well built. If the lord of a house be weak or be occupied or otherwise \\n\\nafflicted by a malefic, the corresponding part of the body will be weak or diseased.\\n\\n5. The dwelling  of the twelve  signs Aries,  Taurus, Gemini,  Cancer, Leo, \\n\\nVirgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius and Pisces are — (1) forest \\n\\n(2) agricultural land with water (3) bedroom (4) chasm with water (5) mountain (6) \\n\\nland with water and food crops (7) house of a Vaishya (8) cavity or a hole (9) \\n\\nresidence of the king (10) watery forests (11) the spot frequented or used by potters \\n\\nand (12) water, in that order.\\n\\nNotes — Generally this information proves useful in queries regarding theft \\n\\nof articles or missing persons etc.\\n\\n6. The lords of the twelve signs are as under:\\n\\nAries – Mars\\n\\nLibra - Venus\\n\\nTaurus – Venus\\n\\nScorpio - Mars\\n\\nGemini - Mercury \\n\\nSagittarius - Jupiter\\n\\nCancer - The Moon\\n\\nCapricorn - Saturn\\n\\n11\\n\\n\\x0cLeo - The Sun \\n\\nAquarius - Saturn\\n\\nVirgo - Mercury \\n\\nPisces - Jupiter\\n\\nThe signs of exaltation and fall of the seven planets from the Sun onwards \\n\\nare as under —\\n\\nSign of exaltation \\n\\nPlanet \\nThe Sun  Aries \\nThe Moon  Taurus \\nMars \\nMercury  Virgo \\nJupiter \\nVenus \\nSaturn \\n\\nCancer \\nPisces \\nLibra \\n\\nCapricorn \\n\\nSign of fall \\nLibra \\nScorpio \\nCancer \\nPisces \\nCapricorn \\nVirgo \\nAries \\n\\nThis means that the seventh or the opposite sign from the sign of exaltation \\n\\nof a planet, is the sign of fall or debilitation.\\n\\nNotes— There is great difference of opinion amongst the ancient learneds \\n\\nabout the exaltation and debilitation  signs of Rahu and Ketu.  Mantreswara has \\n\\nexpressed   no   opinion   in   that   regard.   According   to   Sarvarth   Chintamani   the \\n\\nexaltation   sign   of   Rahu   is   Gemini   and   his   sign   of   debilitation   is   Sagittarius. \\n\\nReverse is the case with Ketu. According to Brihat Parasara Hora Sastra Taurus \\n\\nand Scorpio are respectively the exaltation signs of Rahu and Ketu and the signs \\n\\nopposite to them are their signs of debilitation.\\n\\nThe highest points of exaltation and the lowest points of debilitation of the \\n\\nvarious planets are as under:\\n\\nPlanet \\n\\nHighest points of exaltation\\n(Deep exaltation) \\nThe Sun \\nAries 10th degree \\nThe Moon  Taurus 3rd degree \\nMars \\nMercury  Virgo 15th degree \\nCancer 5th degree \\nJupiter \\nPisces 27th degree \\nVenus \\nLibra 20th degree \\nSaturn \\n\\nCapricorn 28th degree \\n\\nLowest point of debilitation\\n(Deep fall) \\nLibra 10th degree \\nScorpio 3rd degree \\nCancer 28th degree \\nPisces 15th degree \\nCapricorn 5th degree \\nVirgo 27th degree \\nAries 20th degree \\n\\nNotes — For example Jupiter at the 5th degree of Cancer will be in deep \\n\\nexaltation. Then he moves downwards from that point and gets into deep debilition \\n\\n12\\n\\n\\x0cwhen he reaches 5th degree of Capricorn.\\n\\n7. The Moolatrikona signs of the planets the Sun onward are Leo, Taurus, \\n\\nAries, Virgo, Sagittarius,  Libra  and Aquarius respectively. Below  are given  the \\n\\nportions of the own sign and Moolatrikona from the Sun onwards :—\\n\\nSign \\nLeo \\n\\nPlanet \\nThe Sun \\nThe Moon  Taurus \\nMars \\nMercury \\nJupiter \\nVenus \\nSaturn \\n\\nMoola trikona portion  Own sign portion \\n0° - 20° \\n4° - 30° \\n0° - 2° \\nAries \\n16° - 20° \\nVirgo \\nSagittarius  0° - 10° \\n0° - 5° \\nLibra \\n0° - 20° \\nAquarius \\n\\n21° - 30° \\n- \\n13° - 30° \\n21° - 30° \\n11° - 30° \\n6° - 30° \\n21° - 30° \\n\\nThe various signs have been classified as biped or human signs, reptile or \\n\\n(Keeta) or centipeds, watery or quadruped (Chatuspada) as detailed below :\\n\\nHuman \\nGemini \\nVirgo \\n\\nQuadruped  Centiped  Watery \\nCancer \\nScorpio \\nAries \\nCapricorn \\nTaurus \\n(later half) \\n\\nPisces \\n\\nLibra \\nSagittarius\\n(first half) \\n\\nLeo \\n\\nSagittarius \\n(later half) \\nAquarius  Capricorn \\n(first half) \\n\\n8. The signs which rise with their back (Prishtodaya) are Taurus. Cancer, \\n\\nAries   and   Capricorn.   The   signs   which   rise   both   from   their   back   and   front \\n\\n(Ubhayodaya) are Gemini and Pisces. The rest appear with their heads are called \\n\\nSirsodaya signs.\\n\\nThe Prishtodaya signs Taurus, Cancer, Sagittarius, Aries and Capricorn and \\n\\nthe   Ubhayodaya   sign   Gemini   fall   under   the   jurisdiction   of   the   Moon   and   are \\n\\ntermed as nocturnal (strong at night). The other signs are governed by the Sun and \\n\\nare known as diurnal signs (strong during day time).\\n\\nCount from the sign last passed by the Sun. The first sign is called Urdhawa \\n\\n13\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0c(bending upwards) the second sign is known as Adah (beneath), the third sign is \\n\\ntermed Sama (even) and the fourth sign is known as Vakra (Crooked). The same \\n\\norder applies for the other eight signs.\\n\\nNotes — For example the Sun has last passed Virgo.

[In a birth  chart  there are  twelve house. Each house has been given \\n\\nseveral names indicating the various subjects it deals with.]\\n\\nThe names by which the first house or the Ascendant is known are Lagna, \\n\\nHora, Kalya, Deha, Udaya, Rupa, Seersha, Vartmana (present) and Janma.\\n\\nThe   second   house   deals   with   Vitta   (wealth),   Vidya   (learning).   Swa, \\n\\nAnnapana (riches, food and drinks), Bhukti (eating), the right eye, face (Asya), \\n\\nletter or document (Patrika), Speech (Vak) and Kutumba (family) and thus adopts \\n\\nthese appellations.\\n\\n14\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0c11.-12.   — The   names   given   (or   the   subjects   allotted)   to   third   house   are \\n\\nDuschikya, Uras (breast), the right ear, army valour, prowess and brother.\\n\\nThe subjects or designations for the fourth house are house, land, maternal \\n\\nuncle,   a   sister\\'s   son,   a   relation,   a   friend,   conveyance,   mother,   kingdom,   cow, \\n\\nbuffalo, perfume, clothes, ornaments, the nadir, hibuka, sukha (happiness), water, \\n\\nbridge and river.\\n\\nThe fifth house deals with (and has designations accordingly) the mark of \\n\\nthe   sovereign,   taxes,   soul,   intelligence,   knowledge   of   the   future,   life,   progeny, \\n\\nbelly, Vedic knowledge and other religious scriptures.\\n\\n13. — The sixth house deals with debts, arms, thieves, wounds, diseases, \\n\\nenemies, paternal relations, battle, wicked acts, sins, fear and humilialtion.\\n\\nThe subjects dealt with by the seventh house are desire, passion, setting, \\n\\nsexual desire, a way, people, husband road and wife.\\n\\n14. — For the eighth house subjects allotted are Mangalya (the living of the \\n\\nhusband during the life time of the wife), Randhra, filthiness, mental pain, defeat \\n\\nor humiliation, longevity, sorrow, blame, death, impurity impediments and slavery.\\n\\nThe   ninth   house   deals   with   preceptor   (guru),   deity   (devta),   father, \\n\\nauspiciousness, poorvabhagya (previous luck), worship, penance, virtuous act or \\n\\nvirtue, grand son, and noble family. (Some of the learneds in the North are of the \\n\\nview that all about father should be examined from the 10th house, because 10th is \\n\\n7th to the 4th house dealing with the father. The view of Phaladeepika seems to be \\n\\nbased  on  the  logic   that  the   9th  being   5th  to   5th  house  (dealing  with   progeny) \\n\\nshould be the most appropriate house to be connected with father).\\n\\n15. The subjects (names) designated for the 10th house are business or trade, \\n\\nranker  position,  honour, occupation, profession, sky or  zenith,  conduct, quality, \\n\\ninclination, gait, command and Meshurana (to give orders).\\n\\nThe matters to be considered from the eleventh house are gains, income, \\n\\nacquisition, receipt of wealth, accomplishment,  splendor and prosperity, profits, \\n\\nveneration, elder brother or sister, left ear, anything juicy, delightful news.\\n\\n16. The expressions used for the twelfth house are misery, leg, left eye, loss, \\n\\n15\\n\\n\\x0cspy, last rites, poverty, sins, bad expenditure and imprisonment or confinement.\\n\\nDescribed above are the designations of the twelve houses or the subject \\n\\nmatters to be examined from them. The 3rd, the 6th, the 8th and 12th are known as \\n\\nLeena Sthanas (hidden houses).\\n\\n17. The 6th, the 8th and 12th houses are also called Dusthanas (evil houses). \\n\\nThe remaining houses are considered good and auspicious. The 1st, 4th, 7th and \\n\\nthe 10th houses are termed as Kendra, Kantaka or Chatushtaya.\\n\\n18. The 2nd, the 5th, the 8th and 11th houses from the Ascendant are called \\n\\nPanaphara houses. The 3rd, the 6th, the 9th and the 12th are termed as Apoklima \\n\\nhouses. The 4th and the 8th are also known as Chaturasra houses. The 3rd, the 6th, \\n\\nthe 10th and 11th are Upachaya houses. The 5th and 9th are called trines (Trikona \\n\\nhouses). The trines have been considered as very auspicious houses.\\n\\nThus ends the  first chapter on \"Definitions\" in Phaladeepika composed by \\n\\nMantreswara.\\n\\n16\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 2\\n\\nInformation and Characteristic features of planets\\n\\nBefore we come to the verses of this chapter it is necessary to explain its \\n\\nobjects. In the previous chapter it has been described what each house stands for. It \\n\\nis   proposed   to   state   in   this   chapter   what   purpose   and   what   object   each   planet \\n\\nsignifies.\\n\\nIf a house stands for a certain subject matter, the lord of the house will also \\n\\nbe  considered   to   be   concerned   with   it.   For   example,   the   6th   house   deals   with \\n\\nenemies. Naturally the same subject will have to be examined from the lord of the \\n\\n6th house. This is so because of his lordship of the 6th house. Here we have to \\n\\nconsider also the natural or inherent characteristics and functions of that planet. Let \\n\\nus suppose that in ten birth charts, the Sun is lord of the ten different houses. There \\n\\nis doubt that as lord of the Ascendant Sun will function in that capacity and as lord \\n\\nof the 2nd. he will be concerned with wealth; but he will also, in course of its \\n\\neffects, will produce results of his inherent qualities and characteristics. This is \\n\\nwhat is intended to be explained in this chapter.\\n\\n1. The Sun is the singnificator of the person\\'s collection of copper and gold, \\n\\nand of father, patience, valour, victory in war, one\\'s soul (Atman), auspiciousness, \\n\\nhappiness,   prowess,   power,   light,   any   work   relating   to   Lord   Shiva,   travels   in \\n\\nforests and mountains, havans or yajnas, Inclinations for work, temple, acuteness, \\n\\nenthusiasm. Wise men should act according to these significations.\\n\\n2. The Moon is the signiflcator of the welfare of the mother, tranquilityof the \\n\\nmind, bathing in the sea, white chamar, umbrella, good fan, fruits, flowers, tender \\n\\nobjects, farming grains, fame, pearls, silver, bell metal, beauty. In other words all \\n\\nabout the above matters should be ascertained from the Moon.\\n\\n3. All about one\\'s strength (physical and mental), products produced from \\n\\nthe earth, qualities of the brothers and sisters, cruelty, battle, courage, antagonism, \\n\\nthe   fire   of   the   kitchen,   gold,   kinsmen,   weapons,   thieves,   enemies,   enthusiasm, \\n\\nsexual intercourse with another man\\'s wife, falsehood, prowess, high thinking, sin, \\n\\n17\\n\\n\\x0cwounds,   and   acquisition   of   the   position   of   a   commander-in-chief   should   be \\n\\nascertained from Mars.\\n\\nIn other words Mars is the signiflcator of these matters.\\n\\n4.   From   Mercury   is   to   be   ascertained   all   about   learning,   eloquence, \\n\\nproficiency in arts, praise by learned people, maternal uncle, dexterity in speech, \\n\\naptness   for   acquiring   knowledge,   expertise   in   ways   of   worship,   intelligence, \\n\\nreligious acts relating to Lord Shiva, truthfulness, oyster, spots of recreation and \\n\\nenjoyment, skill in mechanical arts, kinsmen, heir apparent, friends, sister\\'s sons \\n\\nand daughters etc.\\n\\n5. Jupiter is concerned with matters relating to knowledge, noble qualities, \\n\\nsons   (progeny),   minister,   good   behavior,   imparting   knowledge   or   teaching, \\n\\nmagnanimity, knowledge of shruties, shastras, smrities, progress in every direction, \\n\\nbeautitude,   devotion   towards   gods   and   Brahmins,   sacrifice,   penance,   religious \\n\\nfaith,   treasury,   mastering   the   senses,   honour,   kindness   and   happiness   of   the \\n\\nhusband.\\n\\nNote — In a female\\'s horoscope Jupiter should be taken as the significator of \\n\\nthe husband. In a male\\'s horoscope Jupiter, among other matters, is the significator \\n\\nfor progeny (San tan Karaka).\\n\\n6.   All   about   one\\'s   wealth,   conveyances,   clothes,   ornaments,   treasures \\n\\n(including   hidden   treasures),   amalgam   of   song,   dance   and   instrumental   music, \\n\\nscents,   flowers,   co-habitation,   bed,   house,   richness,   fondness   for   poetry, \\n\\nIndulgence in all kinds of comforts and luxuries, ministership, soft-spokenness, \\n\\nmarriage and other holy deeds, celebrations, etc., should be ascertained through \\n\\nVenus.\\n\\nNote — In a male\\'s horoscope all about the happiness of wife and marital \\n\\nhappiness should be considered through Venus. Venus is the significator for wife in \\n\\nsuch a chart.\\n\\nSignificator   is   of   very   great   importance   in   assessing   a   birth   chart.   For \\n\\nexample on a particular case of Aquarius Ascendant, the native was of about 22 \\n\\nyears with the Dasa of Venus in operation. Some astrologers predicted that the \\n\\n18\\n\\n\\x0cmarriage of the native would take place in his 24th years after the commencement \\n\\nof the Dasa of the Sun lord of the 7th house. The marriage actually took place in \\n\\nthe Dasa of Venus.\\n\\n7. The significations of Saturn are longevity, death, fear, downfall, disgrace, \\n\\nsickness, unhappiness and misery, poverty, humiliation, sins, labour, filth, censure, \\n\\nmisfortune, impurity of mind, observance of certain formalities after death in the \\n\\nfamily, stability, taking shelter from menials, buffaloe, drowsiness, debts, articles \\n\\nof iron, service, slavery, confinement, getting arrested, agricultural implements etc.\\n\\nNotes — In verses 8 to 14 we shall deal with the features and temperament \\n\\nof the planets and their utility in the judgement of a birth chart. A planet in the \\n\\nAscendant of a nativity bestows his qualities and characteristics to the native. If in \\n\\na   person\\'s   chart   Mars   is   in   the  Ascendant,   the   native   will   have   an   aggressive \\n\\ntemperament. He will be courageous and fond of quarrels and fights. The sign in \\n\\nwhich Mars is posited in the Ascendant will also have its influence. If a Mars with \\n\\nstrength is in the Ascendant, the native will fight wars with valour as a commander. \\n\\nIf   such   Mars   is   weak,   the   native   is   likely   to   pick   up   petty   and   mean   type   of \\n\\nquarrels. If there is no planet in the Ascendant the native assumes the appearance \\n\\nand   characteristics   of   the   lord   of   the  Ascendant.   The   planets   who   aspect   the \\n\\nAscendant also inject the Influence of their characteristics and temperament in the \\n\\nnative. If a planet in any chart becomes the cause of any disease, the nature of the \\n\\ndisease will be according to the temperament of that planet. For example, the Sun \\n\\nwill cause bilious troubles and Saturn will give windy troubles.\\n\\n8. The temperament of the Sun is bilious. He has strong bones in his body. \\n\\nHe has scanty hair. He has a dark red form. His eyes are of reddish-brown color. \\n\\nHe is dressed in red colored clothes. His body is square built. He is brave and \\n\\npossesses massive arms.\\n\\n9. The body of the Moon is huge. She is young as well as old. She is lean \\n\\nand thin and white. Her eyes are attractive and her hair is black and thin. She has \\n\\njurisdiction over blood. She is soft-spoken. She is dressed in white colored clothes \\n\\nand  possesses   fair   complexion.  She   is   mild   in   temperament   and  has   wind   and \\n\\n19\\n\\n\\x0cphlegm in her composition.\\n\\n10.   Mars   has   lean   waist.   His   hair   is   curly   and   bright.   There   is   cruelty \\n\\n(fierceness) in his look. He has a cruel nature and is bilious. He is dressed in red \\n\\nclothes and his body has a red hue. He is wrathful but exceedingly generous. He \\n\\nlooks youthful and has jurisdiction over marrow in the body.\\n\\nNotes — Mars is said to be youthful in appearance. The implication of this \\n\\nis if Mars is strong in the Ascendant or as lord of the Ascendant, the native will \\n\\nhave a youthful appearance even if he is older in age.\\n\\n11. Mercury is green like Durva (a kind of grass). There is mixture of wind, \\n\\nbile and phlegm in his composition. His body is full of veins. He is soft-spoken by \\n\\nnature. He has a balanced built (that is, his limbs are in even proportion). He is \\n\\nfond of fun and frolic. He governs the skin.\\n\\n12. Jupiter has a body with a yellowish hue. His eyes and hair are brown. \\n\\nHis chest is firm and elevated. He has a huge body. Phlegm is predominant in his \\n\\ncomposition. He is very intelligent. His voice is like that of a lion or the sound of a \\n\\nconch.   He   is   always   after   wealth   (Jupiter   has   therefore   been   considered   as \\n\\nsigniflcator of wealth).\\n\\n13. Venus is dressed in clothes of various colors. He possesses curly hair. He \\n\\nhas  a  huge body  with  similar   limbs.  Phlegm  and wind   are  predominant   in  his \\n\\ncomposition. His body is of the color of Durva sprout. He has a very beautiful \\n\\nappearance. He has broad eyes. He has well maintained his virile power (Venus has \\n\\njurisdiction over semen in the body).\\n\\n14. Saturn is lame. His eyes are deepset. He has a large but lean body full of \\n\\nveins. He is lazy by nature. The color of his body is black. There is predominance \\n\\nof wind in his composition. He is hard hearted and backbiter. He is dull-headed. \\n\\nHis teeth and nails are large. His hair and limbs are stiff. He is impure. He has a \\n\\nfierce appearance and is ill tempered by nature. He is dressed in black clothes. He \\n\\nlooks old.\\n\\n15. The places governed by the Sun are a Shiva temple, open spaces, places \\n\\nwhere there is light, regions where there is no water and the Eastern quarter.\\n\\n20\\n\\n\\x0cThe   Moon   has   jurisdiction   over   the   temple   of   Goddess   Durga,   places \\n\\ninhabited by women, places where water, medicinal herbs, honey and wine are \\n\\navailable and the North-Western quarter.\\n\\nThe places concerned with Mars are the battle field, those where there is \\n\\nfire, those inhabited by thieves and low people and the Southern quarter.\\n\\nThe governance of Mercury extends to places where there is a temple of \\n\\nLord Vishnu, those frequented by men of learning, those of recreation, those where \\n\\nMathematics is practiced and the Northern quarter.\\n\\n16. Jupiter has jurisdiction over treasury, peepal trees, places, inhabited by \\n\\ngods and Brahmins, and the North-Eastern quarter.\\n\\nThe   places   coming   under   the   administration   of   Venus   are   abodes   of \\n\\ncourtesans, the harem, bed rooms, dining halls, and the South-Eastern quarter.\\n\\nSaturn rules over places inhabited by low class people, temple of Shasta (a \\n\\ndeity), those which are full of filth and the Western quarter.\\n\\nThe places belonging to Rahu and Ketu are the ant-hills, the dark holes of \\n\\nserpents and the South-Western quarter.\\n\\n17-20. A worshipper of Lord Shiva, a physician (Vaidya), a king, one who \\n\\nperforms   yajna,   a   minister,   tiger,   deer   and   chako   (the   ruddy   goose)   are   the \\n\\nsignifications of the Sun.\\n\\nThe Moon rules over worship of Shasta (a deity) females, a washerman, a \\n\\ncultivator, an animal living in water, a hare, an antelope crane, birds known as \\n\\nBagula and Chakor.\\n\\nMars   has   jurisdiction   over   a   cook   (in   the   kitchen),   an   armed   person,   a \\n\\ngoldsmith, a ram, a cock, a jackal, a monkey, a vulture and a thief.\\n\\nMercury is concerned with a milkman, a person of learning, an artisan, an \\n\\nexpert accountant, a devotee of Lord Vishnu, Garuda, a Chataka, a parrot and a cat.\\n\\nAn astrologer, a minister, a Brahmin, a preceptor, a sanyasi, and important \\n\\npersonage, a pigeon, a horse and swan belong to Jupiter.\\n\\nA wealthy man, a songster, a Vaishya (businessman), a sensualist, a dancer, a \\n\\nweaver, a prostitute, a peacock, a cow, a buffaloe and a parrot are represented by \\n\\n21\\n\\n\\x0cVenus.\\n\\nSaturn has influence over a seller or buyer of oil. servant, a mean person, a \\n\\nhunter, a blacksmith, an elephant, a crow and a cuckoo.\\n\\nA Buddhist, a snake catcher, a donkey, a wolf, a camel, a serpent or snake, \\n\\nmosquitoes, a bug, insects, an owl and a place of darkness are signified by Rahu \\n\\nand Ketu.\\n\\n21-22.   In   these   verses   has   been   described   the   friendship,   enmity   and \\n\\nneutrality  of the various planets to each other. This is summarized in the table \\n\\ngiven below:\\n\\nPlanet \\nSun \\n\\nMoon \\n\\nMars \\n\\nFriend \\nMoon, \\nMars \\nJupiter \\nSun\\nMercury \\n\\nSun, Moon, \\nJupiter \\n\\nNeutral \\nMercury \\n\\nEnemy \\nVenus \\nSaturn \\n\\n----- \\n\\nMars, \\nMercury \\nVenus, Saturn \\nVenus, Saturn Mercury \\n\\nMercury  Sun, Venus  Mars, Jupiter \\n\\nMoon \\n\\nJupiter \\n\\nSun, Moon, \\nMars \\n\\nSaturn \\nSaturn \\n\\nMercury \\nVenus \\n\\nVenus  Mercury, \\n\\nMars, Jupiter  Sun, Moon \\n\\nSaturn \\n\\nSaturn  Mercury, \\n\\nJupiter \\n\\nVenus \\n\\nSun, Moon \\nMars \\n\\n23. Planets are mutually friendly for the time being when they occupy the \\n\\n2nd,   3rd,   4th,   10th,   11th   and   12th   houses   from   one   another.   (This   means   that \\n\\nplanets occupying the 1st, 5th, 6th 7th, 8th, and 9th from one another are mutually \\n\\ninimical). After taking into account the natural friendship and enmity, it should be \\n\\ndeduced   whether   they   are   friendly,   very   friendly,   neutral,   inimical   and   very \\n\\ninimical to one another.\\n\\nNote — Apart from the neutral or natural friendship and enmity amongst the \\n\\nplanets, account is taken of the for the time being (Tatkalik) enmity and friendship \\n\\n22\\n\\n\\x0camongst the planets as posited in a particular birth chart. The planets posited in the \\n\\n2nd, 3rd, 4th, 10th, 11th and 12th from a particular planet are his friends for the \\n\\ntime being. The 1st, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th and 9th from him become his enemies for the \\n\\ntime being. After taking into account the natural relationship, we come to know \\n\\nwhat their  actual relationship  is in a particular  birth  chart. This is done in the \\n\\nfollowing manner :\\n\\n1.  Natural friend \\n\\n(Naisargik mitra) \\n\\n2.  Natural friend \\n\\n(Naisargik Mitra) \\n\\n3.  Natural enemy \\n(Naisargik \\nShatru) \\n\\n4.  Natural enemy \\n(Naisargik \\nShatru) \\n\\n5.

However, the aspects of Saturn on the 3rd and 10th houses \\n\\nfrom him, of Jupiter on the 5th and 9th houses from him and of Mars on the 4th \\n\\nand 8th houses are also treated as full aspects.\\n\\n24. The following table shows the periods, castes, gunas (Satwa, Rajas, and \\n\\nTamas) and the seasons governed by the various planets according to this verse.\\n\\nGuna \\n\\nCaste \\n\\nSeason \\n\\nPeriod \\nPlanet \\nHalf a year  Kshatriya  Satwik  Grishma \\nSun \\n2 Ghatikas  Vaishya \\nMoon \\nKshatriya  Tamsik  Grishma \\nOne day \\nMars \\nSudra \\nMercury  2 months \\nBrahmin  Satwik  Hemanta \\n1 month \\nJupiter \\nBrahmin  Rajsik  Vasanta \\n15 days \\nVenus \\nSaturn  One year  Outcaste  Tamsik  Shishir \\n\\nRajsik  Sharad \\n\\nSatwlk  Varsha \\n\\n23\\n\\n\\x0c25. The Sun is signiflcator of father if the birth is during the day time and \\n\\nuncle if the birth is during night time.

The Sun represents the soul and the Moon the body. Mars and the other \\n\\nfour   planets   denote   the   five   senses.  The   Sun   and   Mars   govern  Teja   and   have \\n\\ninfluence over eye sight. The Moon and Venus rule over the generative organs \\n\\nbecause they govern the watery element. Mercury governs smell (nose). Jupiter \\n\\ngoverns sound (the capacity to hear). Saturn, Rahu and Ketu govern the touch.\\n\\nRahu, Ketu and Gulik are enemies of the Sun and will cause distress to the \\n\\nbody and the soul.\\n\\n27. The waning Moon, the Sun, Mars, Saturn, Rahu and Ketu are classified \\n\\nas malefic planets. Mercury if associated with them becomes malefic.\\n\\nNotes — The waxing Moon and Mercury not associated with malefics will \\n\\nbe treated as benefic.\\n\\nMercury,  Ketu   and   Saturn   are   eunuchs.  The   Moon,   Rahu   and  Venus   are \\n\\nfemales.   The   Sun,   Mars   and   Jupiter   are   males.   The   Sun   belongs   to   the   fiery \\n\\nelement and his ruling deity is Rudra. The Moon belongs to the watery element and \\n\\nher ruling deity is Amba (Parvati). The ruling deities of Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, \\n\\nVenus, Saturn Rahu and Ketu are Kartika, Vishnu, Brahma, Lakshmi and Yama. \\n\\nSerpent Adhishesha and Braham respectively.\\n\\nFire, water, fire, earth, ether, water and air are the constituents respectively \\n\\nof the planets from Sun to Saturn.\\n\\n24\\n\\n\\x0c28.

The   substances   assigned   to   the   planets   from   the   Sun   to   Saturn, \\n\\narticles of their apparel and their tastes are as follows.

Rahu is blue colored. He has a huge body. He is of a low caste. He has \\n\\ngot skin disease. He is irreligious. He suffers from hic-cough.\\n\\nHe   speaks   falsehood.   He   is   cunning,   a   leper   devoid   of   Intelligence   and \\n\\ndefames others.\\n\\n34. The eyes of Ketu are reddish with a fierce look. He has a venomous \\n\\ntongue. His body is elevated. He wears arms and is an outcaste. His body is of \\n\\nsmoky color. He is always inhaling smoke (smoking). He has a body marked with \\n\\nbruises. He is lean and brutal by nature.\\n\\n35. The substance assigned to Rahu is lead and his clothes are old and worn \\n\\nout. An earthen pot and garments of variegated colors belong to Ketu.\\n\\nMercury, Saturn and Venus are the friends of Rahu and Ketu. Mars is neutral \\n\\nto them. The rest are enemies.\\n\\n36. The planets should be considered adversely disposed, if they are eclipsed \\n\\n(by the rays of the Sun), debilitated (be in a sign of debilitation or Navamsa), if \\n\\nthey are in any enemy\\'s house or if they occupy the 6th, 8th or the 12th house from \\n\\nthe Ascendant. If they occupy other places, they are said to be well disposed.\\n\\nIf   there   be   a  query   whether   the   water   in   a   reservoir   (or   in   an   irrigation \\n\\nproject)  will   increase   or  decrease,  increase   in   water   should  be  predicted  if   the \\n\\nMoon be in the 12th 11th, 1st, 6th. 5th or the 7th house at the time of the query.\\n\\nNotes — The Moon is said to be eclipsed if she is 12° away from the Sun. \\n\\n26\\n\\n\\x0cMars is eclipsed when he is 17° away from the Sun. Mercury in direct motion is \\n\\neclipsed when he is 14° away from the Sun. Retrograde Mercury is eclipsed when \\n\\nhe is 12° away form the Sun. Jupiter, Venus and Saturn are said to be eclipsed if \\n\\nthey are 11°, 10° and 15° respectively away from the Sun. A retrograde Venus is \\n\\neclipsed if he is 8° away from the Sun.\\n\\n37. The various kinds of trees and plants signified by the different planets \\n\\nare as follows :—\\n\\nSun - Strong and tall, Moon and Venus - Creeping plants, Rahu and Ketu - \\n\\nClump of a tree or bush Mars and Saturn - Thorny trees, Jupiter - Fruit bearing \\n\\ntrees. Mercury - Fruitless trees.\\n\\nThe trees which blossom and which supply some kind of juice belong to the \\n\\nMoon   and   Venus.   The   trees   which   are   juiceless   or   weak   come   under   the \\n\\njurisdiction of Saturn. Saal trees are ruled by Rahu.\\n\\nThus  ends   the   second   chapter   on   \"Planets   and   their   Varieties\"   In  \\n\\nPhaladeepika composed by Mantreswara.\\n\\n27\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 3\\n\\nDivisions of a sign\\n\\n1. The ten-fold division of the Zodiac is known as Dasa vargas (Vargas mean \\n\\ndivisions). Under the scheme of Dasavarga the various divisions are as Under :—\\n\\n(1) Rasi \\n(2) Hora \\n(3) Drekkana \\n(4) Trimsamsa \\n\\nEach Rasi 30° \\n2 parts of a Rasi of 15° each. \\n3 parts of a Rasi of 10° each. \\n5 parts of 5°, 7° or 8° each. (All parts \\nare not equal) \\n7 parts of 4°-17\"-8\" each. \\n9 parts of 3°-20 each. \\n10 parts of 3°each. \\n\\n(5) Saptamsa \\n(6) Navamsa \\n(7) Dasmamsa \\n(8) Dwadasamsa  12 parts of 2°-30\\' each. \\n(9) Shodasamsa  16 parts of l°-16\\'-52\" each. \\n(10) Shastyamsa  60 parts of 30\\' each. \\n\\nVargottama is the name given to that particular Navamsa in a Rasi which \\n\\nbears the same sign as that of Rasi itself.\\n\\n2.   If   amongst   the   ten   vargas   only   the   Rasi,   Hora,   Drekkana,   Navamsa, \\n\\nDwadasamsa and Trimsamsa are taken into consideration, the divisions are known \\n\\nas Shad vargas. If we add Saptamsa division to them, the 7 kinds of divisions are \\n\\nknown as Sapta vargas.\\n\\nSome learneds have taken the view that the effect emanating from Navamsa \\n\\nis equal to that of Rasi and Bhava.\\n\\n3. In Rasis the effect is full. In the Shodasamsa, Dasmamsa and Shastyamsa \\n\\ndivisions (Vargas) it is one-fourth. In the other vargas it is half. In an odd Rasi, the \\n\\nplanets are said to be in \\'infancy, in boyhood, youth, in middle age and in very old \\n\\nage   (near   death),   according   to   first,   second,   third,   fourth   and   last   six   degree \\n\\nportions respectively reached by them in a sign. But in an even sign this is in the \\n\\nreverse order.\\n\\nNotes — In Aries, Gemini, Leo, Libra, Sagittarius  and Aquarius there is \\n\\ninfancy up to 6 degrees, up to 12° boyhood, from there to 18° it is youth and up to \\n\\n28\\n\\n\\x0c24° it is middle age and the last 6° comprise the very old age. It is reverse in the \\n\\ncase of even signs viz., Taurus, Cancer, Virgo, Scorpio, Capricorn and Pisces.\\n\\n4. Hora is half of a Rasi. In an odd sign, the halves belong, to the Sun and \\n\\nthe Moon and to the Moon and the Sun when the sign is an even one.\\n\\nThe Drekkana or third portions of a sign belong to the lords of the sign itself, \\n\\nof the 5th house and of the 9th house.\\n\\nThe owners of the Dwadasamas or l/12th portion of a sign are counted from \\n\\nthat sign.\\n\\nIn an odd sign the Trimsamsas or degrees, that is, l/30th portions belonging \\n\\nto Mars, Saturn, Jupiter, Mercury and Venus are respectively 5, 5, 8, 7 and 5. In an \\n\\neven sign it is reversed. Then Venus. Mercury, Jupiter, Saturn and Mars have 5, 7, \\n\\n8, 5 and 5 degrees respectively.\\n\\nThe first Navamsa in the signs from Aries onwards begins respectively with \\n\\nAries, Capricorn, Libra and Cancer.\\n\\n5. In an odd sign in Krura Shastyamsas or inauspicious l/60th portions are \\n\\n1st. 2nd, 8th, 9th. 10th, 11th. 12th. 15th, 18th, 30th, 31st. 32nd. 33rd. 34th, 35th, \\n\\n39th. 40th, 42nd, 43rd, 44th. 48th, 51st. 52nd and 59th. The rest are Saumya or \\n\\nauspicious ones. In the case of an even sign it is necessary, that is, the Shastyamsa \\n\\nportions stated Krura in the odd signs are the Saumya ones in the even signs and \\n\\nvice versa.\\n\\n6. The Saptamsas or the l/7th portion are in the case of an odd sign, counted \\n\\nregularly from the sign itself. In the case of an even sign, they are counted from 7th \\n\\nsign onwards.\\n\\nIn the case of an odd sign, the Dasamamsas or 1/10th portions are counted \\n\\nfrom the sign itself. In the case of an even sign, they are counted from the 9th \\n\\nonwards. The lords of the Shodasamsas or the 1/16th portions in the case of an odd \\n\\nsign are those of the 12th sign counted from that sign Brahma, Vishnu, Hora and \\n\\nRavi. In an even sign this is reversed.\\n\\nIf we have to assess the comparative strength of a planet, we should find out \\n\\nwhether he is in a kendra, trikona, in his own sign, in his moolatrikona sign, in his \\n\\n29\\n\\n\\x0csign   of   exaltation   or   is   vargottama.   Then   we   should   scrutinize   its   portion   in \\n\\nDasavarga or Saptavarga. Some make the assessment only from Dasavarga, others \\n\\nassess the strength and auspiciousness of a planet from thirteen vargas.\\n\\n7. The position of a planet has to be considered with reference to 13 vargas \\n\\nto ascertain whether he is in his friend\\'s house, his own house or in his house of \\n\\nexaltation. The number of such vargas obtained by the planet will result in the \\n\\nattainment of the following kinds of vaiseshikamsas. The combination of 2, 3. 4, 5, \\n\\n6. 7, 8 and 9 vargas are respectively called Parijat, Uttama, Gopura, Simhasana, \\n\\nParvata. Devaloka, Suraloka and Airavata.\\n\\nShri V. Subrahmanya Sastri in his English Translation and Commentary of \\n\\nthis work has given the following example. Suppose Jupiter\\'s position is 8-l°-25\\'-l\" \\n\\nor the 2nd Degree of Dhanus. He occupies his (1) Moolatrikona (2) Drekkana (3) \\n\\nSaptamsa (4) Dasamsa (5) Dwadasamsa and (5) Shodasamsa. Thus Jupiter should \\n\\nbe declared to have attained a Parvatamsa.\\n\\n8-9. The results of a planet attaining various Vaiseshikamsas are as follows:\\n\\nParijat amsa — Respectability, good qualities, wealth, happiness, authority \\n\\nand dignity.\\n\\nUttamamsa — Modest, clever and well-behaved.\\n\\nGopuramsa — Intelligence, wealth, acquisition of lands, cows and house.\\n\\nSimhasanamsa — Makes the native friend of a king or equal to him.\\n\\nParavatamsa — Acquisition of good houses, elephants, vehicles and other \\n\\nprincely appendages.\\n\\nDevalokamsa — Kingship, renown for good qualities.\\n\\nSuralokamsa   —   Endowment   with   good   fortune,   acquisition   of   wealth, \\n\\ngrains, and kingship and birth of children.\\n\\n10. If in a nativity a planet be weak in all the 10 vargas the result will be the \\n\\ndeath of the native. If the planets be weak in 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 out of the 10 \\n\\nvargas the results will be as follows: —\\n\\n9 Vargas — Destruction of the native.\\n\\n8 Vargas — Grief to the native.\\n\\n30\\n\\n\\x0c7 Vargas — Calamity.\\n\\n6 Vargas — Unhappiness.\\n\\n5 Vargas — Love of kinsmen\\n\\n4 Vargas — Foremost in the family\\n\\n3 Vargas — Friend of a king\\n\\n2 Vargas — Wealthy\\n\\n1 Varga — Kingship\\n\\nIf a planet be strong in all the 10 Vargas, the native will be a king of kings.\\n\\nA planet in infancy makes the native progressing. If he is in boyhood the \\n\\nnative achieves happiness. If the planet be adolescent, he endows the native with \\n\\nkingship. The native suffers from ill health If the planet be in middle age. The \\n\\nplanet in old age causes death of the native.\\n\\nNotes — This means that a planet from infancy to youth gives progressively \\n\\nauspicious results and from middle age to old age the results are inauspicious.\\n\\n11. If the benefic planets be endowed with strength in the Shadvargas, the \\n\\nnative will be wealthy and longlived. If the Ascendant falls in the Krura amsas in \\n\\nthe Shadvargas, the native will be shortlived, poor and of wicked disposition but if \\n\\nthe lord of Amsas in which the Ascendant falls, be strong, the person concerned \\n\\nwill become a king (a person with a high status political or administrative).\\n\\nIf the lord of the Navamsa of the Ascendant be strong, the native will be lull \\n\\nof happiness. If the lord of the Drekkana of the Ascendant be strong, the person \\n\\nconcerned will achieve the status like that of a king. If the lord of the Ascendant \\n\\nitself be strong, the native will become the ruler of the Earth and will enjoy good \\n\\nfortune.\\n\\n12. If in any nativity, malefics being in odd signs fall In the Sun\\'s Hora (first \\n\\n15 degrees), the native will be cruel strong and wealthy. Opposite to this, if the \\n\\nbenefics being In even signs occupy the Moon\\'s Hora (first 15 degrees), the native \\n\\nwill be lustrous, humble, soft-spoken, graceful and fortunate. If it be otherwise, the \\n\\nresults will also be of the same nature. If the dispositions be of mixed nature, the \\n\\nresults may be expected accordingly.\\n\\n31\\n\\n\\x0cIf in any nativity, the Ascendant and the Moon be both strong and the lords \\n\\nof the Ascendant and the Moon\\'s sign be also equally strong, the native will be \\n\\nlong-lived, happy and renowned.\\n\\n13. The appearances of the Drekkanas are as under The last Drekkanas or \\n\\ndecanats   of   Leo,  Aries,   Sagittarius,   Libra   and   Gemini,   the   first   decanates   of \\n\\nSagittarius  and Aries  and second ones of Virgo and Gemini are called  Ayudha \\n\\nDrekkanas or \\'armed\\' decanates. The second decanate of Scorpio is called \\'Pasa\\' \\n\\n(noose). The first decanate of Capricorn is called \\'Nigala\\'. The first decanates of \\n\\nLeo and Aquarius and second one of Libra are vulture faced. The first decanate of \\n\\nTaurus is like a \\'Pakshi\\' (bird) and the first decanate of Cancer has a face like a pig.\\n\\n14. The first decanate of Scorpio and third ones of Cancer and Pisces are \\n\\ncalled Serpent decanates. The second decanates of Aries and Taurus, the first of \\n\\nLeo and last of Scorpio are named as quadruped decanates.\\n\\nThe persons born when these decanates are rising will be poor, cruel and \\n\\nunscrupulous.\\n\\nIn  a  dual  sign,  the   three   decanates  in  their  order  will  be  Adhama  (bad), \\n\\nMadhyama (moderate) and Uttama (good). In the case of a moveable sign, the \\n\\norder is reversed, that is, the first will be Uttama and the second madhyama and the \\n\\nlast Adhama. In a fixed sign the order will be Adhama, Uttama and Madhyama. \\n\\nThe effects will be in accordance with the names of the decanates.\\n\\n15. If the lord of the Lagna Drekkana be in his own varga, be associated \\n\\nwith   a   benefic   or   be   in   his   sign   of   exaltation   or   friendly   house;   if   the   rising \\n\\nTrimsamsa, Dwadasamsa or Hora endowed with strength be in a similar position, \\n\\nthe native will be gifted with all noble qualities, will be pure, clever, longlived \\n\\nsympathetic and wealthy, will be blessed with children, will be widely renowned \\n\\nand will enjoy royal comforts.\\n\\n16. Note the Rasi of Mandi at birth and also where the lord of that Rasi is \\n\\nposited. The Ascendant at birth will be in a house 5th or 9th to that of the aforesaid \\n\\nlord or one triangular to the Navamsa occupied by the lord of the Rasi representing \\n\\nthe Navamsa occupied by the Mandi. It may be triangular to the Navamsa Rasi \\n\\n32\\n\\n\\x0coccupied   by   Gulika.   But   if   the   Moon   be   strong,   the   Ascendant   should   be \\n\\nascertained similarly through the Moon and not through Mandi.\\n\\n17. The person concerned will be gifted with attractive appearance and good \\n\\nqualities, if the Moon be in his own Drekkana or a friend\\'s decanate. If the Moon \\n\\nhas   attained   an   Uttama   varga,   the   native   will   be   fortunate.   If   she   is   posited \\n\\nelsewhere, the native will be endowed with qualities belonging to the planet who is \\n\\nthe lord of the Moon\\'s sign. Planets that are in their own Trimsamsa will do all that \\n\\nhas ascribed to them as Karakas.\\n\\nThe native will be wealthy like a king if there be at least one planet in his \\n\\nown exaltation house aspected by or associated with a friendly planet.\\n\\n18-19.  A  planet   is   called   Pradeepta   (blazing)   when   he   is   in   his   sign   of \\n\\nexaltation. He is Sukhita (happy) when he is in Moolatrikona Rasi. He is called \\n\\nSwastha   (healthy)   when   he   is   in   his   own   sign.   He   is   Mudita   (delighted)   in   a \\n\\nfriendly house. He is Shanta (calm) when he has attained the varga of a benefic \\n\\nplanet. He is Shakta (capable) when he shines brightly (not combust by being near \\n\\nthe   Sun).  A  planet   is   Vikala   (distressed)   when   he   is   combust.   He   is   Nlpidita \\n\\n(troubled-tortured) when he is overcome in the planetary war by another planet. He \\n\\nis Khala (base) when he is in the varga of a malefic. He is Sudukhit (exceedingly \\n\\nunhappy), he is Atibheeta (very afraid) when he is in his sign of debilitation.\\n\\n20. The planet in Pradeepta Avastha gives good effects In full. They will be \\n\\nnil when he is In Vikala Avastha. In the intervening Avasthas the auspicious effects \\n\\nwill   be   decreasing   proportionately   and   the   inauspicious   effects   will \\n\\ncorrespondingly  increase. The Avasthas of the  planet  will determine the effects \\n\\naccording to the names given to them.\\n\\nThe   good  or  bad  effects  in   various  Avasthas  are  approximately  as   given \\n\\nbelow: —\\n\\nPradeepta — 100 per cent good. Sukhita — 80 per cent good. Swastha — 75 \\n\\nper cent good. Mudita — 60 per cent good. Shanto — 50 per cent good. Shakta — \\n\\n40 per cent good. Nipidita—40 per cent bad. Khata—50 per cent bad. Sudukhito—\\n\\n60 per cent bad. Attbheeta—75 per cent bad. Vikala—100 per cent bad.\\n\\n33\\n\\n\\x0cThe planets in  good avasthas yield  favourable effects in their  Dasas and \\n\\nAntardasas. The reverse is the case with planets in adverse avasthas.\\n\\nThus ends the third chapter on \"Divisions of the Zodiac\" in Phaladeepika  \\n\\ncomposed by Mantreswara.\\n\\n34\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 4\\n\\nThe various kinds of Strengths of Planets and Houses\\n\\nThis Chapter deals with as to how to assess the strength of the planets and \\n\\nhouses   (bhavas).   In   this   connection   before   mentioning   the   view   of   Shri \\n\\nMantreswara, it will be useful to know the views of other ancients.\\n\\nSix   kinds   of   strength   of   planets   is   an   important   and   very   instructive \\n\\ncontribution of Hindu Astrology. According to our sapient learneds the six kinds of \\n\\nstrengths are (1) Sthan Bala, (2) Drik Bala, (3) Kala Bala, (4) Chesta Bala, (5) \\n\\nNaisargik Bala, and (6) Ayana Bala.\\n\\nSthan Bala — This is of the following twelve kinds:—\\n\\n(1) Uchcha Bala —A planet at his deep exaltation point, is allotted 1 Rupa \\n\\n(60 Shastayamsa). If he is at his deep debilitation point, his strength is nil. At the \\n\\nintervening positions the strength has to be worked out by the rule of three. This is \\n\\nknown as Uchcha Bala.\\n\\n(2)   If   a   planet   is   in   his   Moolatrikona   Rasi   he   gets   36   Shastayamsa   of \\n\\nstrength. In the Rasi of Adhimitra he gets 22.5 Shastayamsa and 15 Shastayamsa if \\n\\nhe is in the sign of a friend. He gets 7.5 Shastayamsa in a neutral Rasi, 3.75 in the \\n\\nRasi of an enemy and 1.875 Shastayamsa in the Rasi of Adhishatru.\\n\\n(3) He gets 30 Shastayamsa in his own Hora, 22.5 Shastayamsa in the Hora \\n\\nof Adhimitra, 15 Shastayamsa in the Hora of a friend, 7.5 Shastayamsa in the Hora \\n\\nof a neutral, 3.75 Shastayamsa in the Hora of an enemy and 1.875 Shastayamsa \\n\\nonly in the Hora of a Adhishatru.\\n\\n(4) He gets 30 Shastayamsa strength in his own decanate, 22.5 Shastayamsa \\n\\nin the decanate of an Adhimitra, 15 Shastayamsa in the decanate of a friend, 7.5 \\n\\nShastayamsa in the decanate of a neutral, 3.75 Shastayamsa in the decanate of an \\n\\nenemy and 1,875 Shastayamsa in the decanate of Adhishatru.\\n\\n(5) He gets 30 Shastayamsa in his own Saptamsa, 22.5 in the Saptamsa of \\n\\nAdhimitra, 15 in the Saptamsa of a friend, 7.5 in the Saptamsa of a neutral, 3.75 in \\n\\nthe   Saptamsa   of   an   enemy   and   1.875   Shastayamsa   in   the   Saptamsa   of   an \\n\\n35\\n\\n\\x0cAdhishatru.\\n\\n(6) He gets 30 Shastayamsa of strength in his own Navamsa. 22.5 in the \\n\\nNavamsa of an Adhimitra, 15 in the Navamsa of a friend. 7.5 in the Navamsa of a \\n\\nneutral, 3.75 in the Navamsa of an enemy and only 1.875 in the Navamsa of an \\n\\nAdhishatru.\\n\\n(7) A planet gets 30 Shastayamsa of strength if he is in own Dwadasamsa, \\n\\n22.5 in the Dwadasamsa of his Adhimitra, 15 in the Dwadasamsa of a friend, 7.5 in \\n\\nthe Dwadasamsa of his neutral, 3.75 in the Dwadasamsa of his enemy and 1.875 in \\n\\nthe Dwadasamsa of his Adhishatru.\\n\\n(8)  A   planet   gets   30   Shastayamsa   in   his   own   Trimsamsa,   22.5   in   the \\n\\nTrimsamsa   of   his   Adhimitra,   15   in   the   Trimsamsa   of   his   friend,   7.5   in   the \\n\\nTrimsamsa of his neutral, 3.75 in the Trimsamsa of his enemy and 1.875 in the \\n\\nTrimsamsa of his Adhishatru.\\n\\n(9) (a) The Sun, Mars, Mercury and Saturn amongst those five whoever is in \\n\\nan Oja  Rasi (viz. Aries,  Gemini,  Leo, Libra,  Sagittarius  and Aquarius)  gets 15 \\n\\nShastayamsa.\\n\\n(b) Amongst the Moon and Venus, whoever is in Yugma (Taurus, Cancer, \\n\\nVirgo, Scorpio, Capricorn or Pisces) Navamsa, gets 15 Shastayamsas.\\n\\n(11)  A  planet   in   Kendra   Rasi   gets   1   Rupa   (60   Shastayamsa).  That   in   a \\n\\nPanaphara   Rasi   gets   30   Shastayamsa   and   on   an   Apoklima   Rasi   gets   15 \\n\\nShastayamsa.\\n\\n(12) (a) Amongst the Sun, Mars and Jupiter whoever is in the first Drekkana \\n\\ngets 15 Shastayamsa of strength. In other Drekkanas they get no strength at all.\\n\\n(b) Amongst Saturn and Mercury, whoever is in the 2nd Drekkana, gets 15 \\n\\nShastayamsa of strength.\\n\\n(c) Amongst the Moon and Venus, whoever is in the last Drekkana. gets 15 \\n\\nShastayamsa of strength.\\n\\nThese 12 combinations are known as Sthan Bala. In Sanskrit they are called, \\n\\n(1)  Uchcha Bala, (2) — (8)  Saptavarga Bala, (9)  Oja Yugma Rasi Bala. (10) \\n\\nOja-Yugma navamsa Bala, (11) Kendradi Bala and (12) Dreshtakana Bala. \\n\\n36\\n\\n\\x0cDrik bala (Directional strength)\\n\\n(a) Amongst the Sun and Mars, whoever Is the 10th Bhava madhya (South) \\n\\ngets 1 Rupja strength. Their strength is nil if they are located in the 4th Bhava \\n\\nmadhya.   In   the   intervening   locations,   the   strength   has   to   be   calculated \\n\\nproportionately.\\n\\n(b) Amongst the Moon and Venus, whoever is in 4th Bhava madhya (North) \\n\\ngets 1 Rupa of strength. Their strength is nil if they are located in the 10th Bhava \\n\\nmadhya.   In   the   intervening   locations   their   strength   has   to   be   calculated \\n\\nproportionately.\\n\\n(c) Amongst Mercury and Jupiter, whoever is in the Bhava madhya of the \\n\\n1st Bhava (Lagna) (East) get 1 Rupa of strength. Their strength is nil if located in \\n\\n7th Bhava madhya (West).\\n\\n(d) If Saturn is in the 7th Bhava madhya, he gets 1 Rupa of strength. In the \\n\\n1st Bhava madhya his strength is nil. In the intervening locations the strength has \\n\\nto be calculated proportionately.\\n\\nKala Bala\\n\\nThis is admixture of the kinds of strength as described below: —\\n\\n(1) (a) The Sun, Jupiter and Venus get 1 Rupa of strength exactly at mid-\\n\\nnoon. Exactly at mid-night they are devoid of any strength. For the intervening \\n\\nperiods the strength has to be calculated proportionately.\\n\\n(b) The Moon, Mars and Saturn get one Rupa of strength if the birth is \\n\\nexactly at mid-night. Exactly at mid-noon, their strength is nil. For the intervening \\n\\nperiods, the strength has to be calculated proportionately.\\n\\n(c) Mercury gets one Rupa of strength if the birth be at any time during the \\n\\nday time.\\n\\n(2) (a) When the Sun and the Moon are at a distance of 180° from each \\n\\nother, the benefics get one Rupa of strength. When they are together the benefics \\n\\nget   no   strength   at   all.   For   the   intervening   distances,   the   strength   has   to   be \\n\\ncalculated proportionately.\\n\\nThe Moon, Mercury, Jupiter and Venus are benefics. Keshavi Jatak is of the \\n\\n37\\n\\n\\x0cview   that   Mercury   if   associated   with   a   malefic   becomes   a   malefic.   But   some \\n\\nAcharyas are of the view that for determining kala Bala Mercury should be treated \\n\\nas a benefic. We support this view.\\n\\n(b) When the Sun and the Moon are In the same sign and the same degree, \\n\\nthe malefics get 60 Shastayamsa (one Rupa of Kala Bala). If they are (the Sun and \\n\\nthe Moon) 180° away from each other, the Kala bala of the malefics will be nil In \\n\\nthe intervening distances, the strength is to be worked out proportionately.\\n\\nThe Sun, Mars and Saturn are malefics.\\n\\nThis strength is known as Paksha Bala which comes under the purview of \\n\\nKala Bala.\\n\\n(c) The Paksha Bala of the Moon should be doubled (the Moon is never \\n\\nretrograde.  Therefore  it  never  gets   Chesta   Bala.  Therefore,  Paksha   Bala  of   the \\n\\nMoon is doubled).\\n\\n(3) (a) Divide the Dinamana (the time between Sunrise  and Sunset) into \\n\\nthree parts, if the birth is during the day. If the birth be in the first part Mercury \\n\\nwill get one Rupa of Paksha Bala. If the birth be in the second part of Dinamana, \\n\\nthe Sun will get one Rupa of Paksha Bala. If the birth be in the 3rd part, Saturn will \\n\\nget one Rupa of this strength.\\n\\n(b) Divide the Ratrimana (the time between Sunset and Sunrise) into three \\n\\nparts, if the birth be during the night. If the birth be in the first part, the Moon will \\n\\nget one Rupa of strength. If the birth be in the second part, Venus will get one Rupa \\n\\nof this strength, and if the birth be in the third part Mars will get similar quantum \\n\\nof strength.\\n\\n(c) Jupiter will get one Rupa of this strength if the birth be at any time \\n\\nduring the 24 hours.\\n\\n(4) One year is of 360 days and one month is of 30 days Find out the day of \\n\\nthe week from which the year commences, the lord of that day becomes the lord of \\n\\nthe year. The lord of the year gets 15 Shastayamsa of strength.\\n\\n(5)   Similarly   find   out   the   day   of   the   week   from   which   the   month \\n\\ncommences, the lord of that day gets 30 Shastayamsa of strength.\\n\\n38\\n\\n\\x0c(6) The lord of the day in which birth takes place, gets 45 Shastayamsa of \\n\\nstrength.\\n\\n(7) The planet in whose hora the birth takes place gets one Rupa of strength.\\n\\nAyana Bala\\n\\n(8) From the centre line of the sky some planets are in the north. Then they \\n\\nare said to have northern declination. If they are in the South they are said to have \\n\\nsouthern declination. One exactly on the centre line has no declination.\\n\\n(a) If the Sun, Moon, Jupiter and Venus have 24° of northern declination \\n\\nthey get 1 Rupa of Ayana Bala. This strength is nil if they have 24° of southern \\n\\ndeclination.   For   the   intervening   declinations,   the   strength   has   to   be   looked \\n\\nproportionately.\\n\\n(b) The Moon and Saturn get one Rupa of Ayana Bala when they have 24° of \\n\\nSouthern   declinations.   For   the   intervening   declinations,   the   strength   has   to   be \\n\\nworked out proportionately.\\n\\n(c) Mercury has been given special consideration in this respect. He gets 30 \\n\\nShastayamsa of Ayana Bala if his declination is 0 degree. The strength increases \\n\\nwith the increase in declination from 0°-24° and he will get one Rupa of Ayana \\n\\nBala when he has 24° of northern declination. He also gets one Rupa of strength \\n\\nwhen his southern declination is 24°. For the intervening degrees of northern and \\n\\nsouthern declinations, the strength has to be calculated proportionately.\\n\\n(d) The Ayan Bala obtained by the Sun is to be doubled because the Sun is \\n\\nalways direct and never retrograde. As he does not get any Chesta Bala, his Ayana \\n\\nBala is doubled.\\n\\nYudha Bala\\n\\n(9) This is the ninth kind of strength under the heading \\'Kala Bala\\'. Besides \\n\\nthe Sun and the Moon if amongst the other planets (Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus \\n\\nand Saturn) any two be in the same Rasi, degree and minute, they are considered to \\n\\nbe at war. For the method to work out Yudha Bala, refer to Sripati Padhati, Keshavi \\n\\nJataka or Brihat Parasara Hora Shastra.\\n\\nChesta Bala\\n\\n39\\n\\n\\x0cThe Sun and the Moon are never retrograde in their motions. The remaining \\n\\nplanets   viz.   Mars,   Mercury,   Jupiter.   Venus   and   Saturn   have   both   direct   and \\n\\nretrograde   motions.   The   strength   which   the   planets   obtain   by   virtue   of   their \\n\\nmotions is called Chesta Bala (Motional strength). To work out this strength the \\n\\nfacts regarding Mandoucha, Kshetra and Kendra etc., have to be worked out. This \\n\\ninvolves lot of arithmetical calculations. It is not possible to give those details here \\n\\nfor lack of space. Still some information in this regard is given below —\\n\\n(a) If the planet is retrograde he gets 60 Shastayamsa (one Rupa) of strength.\\n\\n(b) If he is Anuvakra he gets 30 Shastayamsa of strength.\\n\\n(c) If he is Vikala, he gets 15 Shastayamsa of strength.\\n\\n(d) If he is in Samagama, he gets 30 Shastayamsa of strength.\\n\\n(e) If he is Manda (This means motion be increasing but be less than the \\n\\nmedium motion) and direct he gets 15 Shastayamsa of strength.\\n\\n(f)   If   he   is   Mandatara   (The   motion   be   decreasing   but   be   more   than   the \\n\\nmedium motion) and direct, he gets 15 Shastayamsa of strength).\\n\\n(g) If the motion be fast and be direct, he gets 45 Shastayamsa of strength.\\n\\n(h) If motion be faster, and direct, he obtains 30 Shastayamsa of strength.\\n\\nNaisargik Bala (Inherent strength)\\n\\nThis strength is inherent in the planet and never changes.\\n\\nThe Naisargik Bala of the Sun is 60 Shastayamsa, of the Moon 51.3, of \\n\\nVenus 42.85, of Jupiter 34.28, of Mercury 25.70, of Mars 17.14 and of Saturn 8.57 \\n\\nShastayamsa.\\n\\nDrig Bala\\n\\nThis   kind   of   strength   is   derived   from   aspect.   If   a   planet   is   aspected   by \\n\\nbenefics, the aspect is considered as benefic (favourable). To work out the strength \\n\\nof aspect, the difference in degrees etc., of the aspecting and aspected planet has to \\n\\nbe worked out arithmetically.\\n\\nIf   any   planet   is   aspected   by   malefics,   the   aspect   is   treated   as   malefic \\n\\n(unfavourable). The strength of the aspect is to be worked out arithmetically. For \\n\\ndetails see Sripati Padhati.\\n\\n40\\n\\n\\x0cBhava Bala (The strength of houses or Bhavas)\\n\\nIn working out the strength of houses the strength of the following has to be \\n\\ncalculated —\\n\\n(1) The strength of the lord of the house.\\n\\n(2) The Dik Bala of the house\\n\\n(3) The strength of the benefic aspects.\\n\\nBhava Dik Bala\\n\\n(a) Gemini, Virgo, Libra and first part of Sagittarius are biped signs. If these \\n\\nsigns be in the Lagna, they obtain one Rupa of strength. If they be in the 7th, the \\n\\nstrength will be nil. For the intervening houses, the strength has to be worked out \\n\\nproportionately.\\n\\n(b)  Aries,  Taurus,  Leo,   the   latter  half  of   Sagittarius   and  the  first   half  of \\n\\nCapricorn are quadruped signs. If they represent the 10th house, they achieve one \\n\\nRupa of strength. In the 4th house, their strength will be nil. In between other \\n\\nhouses the strength has to be calculated proportionately.\\n\\n(c) Cancer and Scorpio are Keeta signs. If they represent the 7th house, they \\n\\nget one Rupa of strength. In the first house, their strength will be nil. For the \\n\\nintervening houses, the strength has to be calculated proportionately.\\n\\n(d) Pisces and the latter half of Capricorn are watery signs (Jala Rasis). If \\n\\nthey represent the fourth house, they obtain one Rupa of strength. In the 10th house \\n\\ntheir strength will be nil. For the intervening houses the strength will have to be \\n\\ncalculated proportionately.\\n\\nAuspicious and Inauspicious Drishti (as per Bold)\\n\\nIf there be more of  benefic aspect on a house, deduct quantum of malefic \\n\\naspect from it and the strength of the lord of the house and add Bhawa Dik Bala to \\n\\nit. The result will be the total strength of the house.\\n\\nIf the malefic aspects are more than the benefic aspects, deduct the quantum \\n\\nof the latter from that of the former. Further deduct the result from the total of the \\n\\nstrength of the lord of the house and Bhava Dik Bala. The net result will be the \\n\\nstrength of the house (Bhava) concerned.\\n\\n41\\n\\n\\x0cPlease refer to Jataka Padhati by Bhu Deva for determining the quantums of \\n\\nmalefic   and   benefic   aspects.   Keshavi   Jataka   and   Sripati   Padhati   will   also   be \\n\\nhelpful.\\n\\nNow we come to Shri Mantreswara\\'s views on this subject as given in the \\n\\nfollowing verses in Chapter 4 of Phaladeepika.\\n\\n1. A planet is said to possess six kinds of strength which are in the following \\n\\norder —\\n\\n(1) Kalay or temporal.\\n\\n(2) Chesta Bala or motional strength.\\n\\n(3) Uchcha or that derived from its exaltation position.\\n\\n(4) Dik or directional strength\\n\\n(5) Ayana or that derived from declination (north or south).\\n\\n(6) Sthana Bala or positional strength.\\n\\nMars, the Moon and Venus are strong during the  night time. Mercury is \\n\\nstrong all the 24 hours. The rest viz., the Sun, Jupiter and Saturn are strong during \\n\\nthe day time.\\n\\nThe benefics are strong during the bright half of the month (Shukla Paksha) \\n\\nand the malefics are strong during the dark half of the month (Krishna Paksha).\\n\\nPlanets when they are lords of the year, month, day and house get 1/4, 1/2, \\n\\n3/4, and 1 Rupa of strength respectively. \\n\\n2. The Moon gets Chesta Bala when it is full. The Sun gets this strength \\n\\nwhen he is on the northern course. The other planets get Chesta Bala when they are \\n\\nin retrograde motion.\\n\\nThe planets are victorious in the planetary course when they are in the north \\n\\nand are not combust. A planet is said to possess full Uchcha Bala when he is in \\n\\ndeep exaltation position.\\n\\nAs   regards   directional   strength   or   Dik   Bala   the   Sun   and   Mars   get   this \\n\\nstrength   when   they   are   in   the   10th   house.   Mercury   and   Jupiter   get   directional \\n\\nstrength when they are in the 1st house (Lagna), Saturn gets this strength in the 7th \\n\\nhouse and the Moon and Venus in the 4th house.\\n\\n42\\n\\n\\x0cMercury,   Saturn   and   the   Moon   get  Ayana   bala   when   they   are   on   the \\n\\nSouthern course. The rest are vested with Ayana bala when they are on the northern \\n\\ncourse.\\n\\n3. A planet gets Sthana Bala (positional strength) according to position in his \\n\\nsign of exaltation, in his own sign, in his friend\\'s sign or in the six vargas.\\n\\nA planet obtains one Rupa of strength in a Kendra, 1/2 Rupa in a Panaphara \\n\\nhouse and 1/4 in an Apoklima house.\\n\\nThe hemaphrodite planets are strong in the middle of the sign (11° to 20°), \\n\\nmale planets in the first part of a sign (1° to 10°) and female in the last part of the \\n\\nsign (21° to -30°).\\n\\nSaturn, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, the Moon and the Sun are in their \\n\\nnatural or inherent strength (Nalsarglk Bala). This means Mars is stronger than \\n\\nSaturn, Mercury is stronger than Mars, Jupiter is stronger than Mercury, Venus is \\n\\nstronger than Jupiter; the Moon is stronger than Venus and the Sun is stronger than \\n\\nthe   Moon.  The   Sun   is   the   strongest   and   the   Saturn   is   the   weakest   in   inherent \\n\\nstrength or Naisargik Bala.\\n\\n4. Even if a planet be in his sign of debilitation or debilitated Navamsa, he is \\n\\nvested with full strength if he is retrograde and if his rays are full and brilliant.\\n\\nLike the Moon, a planet will be treated as weak if his rays are eclipsed (on \\n\\naccount  of  being  near  the  Sun)  even  though  he may  be posited  in  his  sign of \\n\\nexaltation, in his own or a friend\\'s sign or Navamsa. This means that even if the \\n\\nMoon be in Taurus or Cancer, if she is very near or with the Sun, she will be \\n\\nconsidered weak. A debilitated Moon when she is full (on Pooran masi night) will \\n\\nbe treated as strong. This principle applies to other planets also.\\n\\n5. All planets are strong when they are posited in their sign of exaltation. \\n\\nThe Moon is strong and auspicious when she has her full Paksha Bala. The Sun has \\n\\nhis full Dik Bala when he is in the 10th house. The other five non-luminous planets \\n\\nare strong when they are retrograde.\\n\\nRahu is strong in Cancer, Taurus, Aries, Aquarius and Scorpio and Ketu is \\n\\nstrong in Pisces, Virgo, Taurus and the latter half of Sagittarius and in Partvesha \\n\\n43\\n\\n\\x0cand Indrachapa when the Sun and the Moon are together in the same sign.\\n\\nNotes. It will be useful to know at this stage now the position of Partvesha \\n\\nand Indrachapa is worked out.\\n\\n(1) Add 4 Rasis 13 degrees and 20 minutes to  the longitude  of the  Sun \\n\\n(Surya) Spasta. The result will be Dhooma.\\n\\n(2) By deducting 12 Rasis from Dhooma we get Vyatipata.\\n\\n(3) Add 6 Rasis to the longitude of Vyatipata, we will get Partvesha.\\n\\n(4)   By   deducting   12   Rasis   from  the   longitude   of   Parivesha,   we   will   get \\n\\nIndrachapa.\\n\\nFor example at birth the Sun\\'s longitude is 7-26°-ll\\'-38\". (1) Longitude of the \\n\\nSun\\n\\n+ \\nDhooma\\n(-) \\n\\n7-26-11-38\\n4-13-20 \\n0-9-31-38\\n12-0-0-0\\n0-9-31-38 \\n11-20-28-22\\n11-20-28-32\\n6-0-0-0 \\n5-20-28-22\\n12-0-0-0\\n5-20-28-22 \\nIndrachapa  6-9-31-38 \\n\\nPartvesha \\n(-) \\n\\nVyatipata \\n(-) \\n\\n6. The first house gets one Rupa of strength if it is a triped sign. If it be \\n\\nVrischika it gets 1 /4 Rupa as its strength. In any other sign the strength will be 1/2 \\n\\nRupa.\\n\\nThe strength of the Ascendant (Lagna) is equal to that of its Lord and is very \\n\\npowerful when the lord occupies an Upachaya house (3, 6, 10, 11). It is also very \\n\\npowerful when it .is aspected by its lord Jupiter or Mercury or when it is occupied \\n\\nby Venus and is at the same time without the conjunction or aspect of any other \\n\\nplanet.\\n\\nThe day signs are strong in births during day time and the night signs in \\n\\nbirth during night time.\\n\\n44\\n\\n\\x0c7. If a planet is in his sign of exaltation he gets one Rupa of positional \\n\\nstrength (Sthana Bala). He gets 3/4 of this strength in his Moolatrikona Rasi, 1/2 \\n\\nRupa in his own sign and 1/4 Rupa in his friend\\'s sign. He gets very little strength \\n\\nwhen   he   is   in   his   enemy\\'s   sign.   If   a   planet   is   in   his   sign   of   depression   or   is \\n\\ncombust, he gets no positional strength at all.\\n\\n8. The planets are vested with full positional strength in the Ascendant (first \\n\\nhouse), 3/4th strength in the 7th house, 1/2 in the 10th house and 1/4 in the 4th \\n\\nhouse. This is how a distinction has been drawn by the astrologers amongst the \\n\\nfour kendras.\\n\\n9. The aspect from the 7th house is the only one that should be considered as \\n\\nmost  effective  in  all  cases. But some learneds  are  of the view  that  the  special \\n\\naspects of Jupiter (to the 5th and the 9th), of Mars (to the 4th and the 8th) and of \\n\\nSaturn (to the 3rd and the 10th) are equally competent in producing effects in all \\n\\nYogas and the like.\\n\\n10. The Naisargik or natural friendship and enmity etc. of the planets is more \\n\\nfully effective and preferable to their corresponding Tatkalik or temporal ones as \\n\\nthe latter is only of changing nature and not of permanent one.\\n\\n11. In warding off evil and in promoting auspicious effects Jupiter is the \\n\\nmost  powerful of all planets. Venus possesses half of the  auspicious effects of \\n\\nJupiter and Mercury possesses only half of that of Venus. But the Moon\\'s strength \\n\\nis the foundation of the strength of all the planets.\\n\\nChandrakriya etc.\\n\\nNow we will be demonstrating the method to work Chandrakriya, Chandra \\n\\nAvastha and Chandravelas specify their effects. In the assessment of a birth chart, \\n\\nquery chart and for Muhurta, full consideration should be given to Chandrakriya, \\n\\nChandra  Avastha   and   Chandravelas.   Chandrakriyas   are   60   in   number,   Chandra \\n\\nAvasthas 12 and Chandravelas 36.\\n\\n12.   Note   the   Nakshatra   at   birth,   query   or   Muhurta.   The   Ghatikas   and \\n\\nVighatikas which have elapsed may be converted into Vighatikas.\\n\\nDivide   this   result   by   (1)   60,   (2)   300   and   (3)   100.   The   three   resulting \\n\\n45\\n\\n\\x0cquotients are named (1) Chandrakriya, (2) chandra Avastha and (3) Chandravela \\n\\nrespectively. Their effects are described below.\\n\\nEffects of Chandrakriyas\\n\\nThe following are the effects of the 60 Chandrakriyas:\\n\\n13-15.

The Chandrakriya, Chandra Avastha and Chandravela described above \\n\\nwill be found very useful and effective in the case of a birth, muhurta and a quary. \\n\\nOne   ought   therefore   to   pay   particular   attention   to   them   before   making   any \\n\\nprediction.\\n\\n21. Paksha Bala (fortnightly strength) is of special importance to the Moon \\n\\nand Sthana Bala is of some importance to the other planets. When this strength \\n\\nadded to other kinds of strength of a planet, it will add more strength to that planet. \\n\\nThere are many such types of strength.\\n\\nNumber of Bala Pinda\\n\\n22. The Sun is said to be strong where he obtains 6.5 Rupas of strength. The \\n\\nMoon is strong with 6 Rupas, Mars with 5 Rupas, Mercury with 7 Rupas, Jupiter \\n\\nwith 8.5 Rupas, Venus with 5.5 Rupas.\\n\\n23. Saturn is declared strong with 5 Rupas of strength. If Shadbala Pinda of \\n\\n49\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cplanet be less than the strength number given above, he will be considered weak. \\n\\nIn this manner the strength of each planet should be taken into account before \\n\\nmaking prediction.\\n\\nNotes: It has already been indicated above what should be the strength of a \\n\\nplanet under Shad Bala scheme, to be declared strong. Now we consider it useful \\n\\nto describe the views of other authorities as to when he should be declared strong \\n\\non the basis of the five kinds of strength viz. (1) Sthan Bala, (2) Dik Bala, (3) \\n\\nChesta Bala, (4) Kala Bala and (5) Ayana Bala. We have not mentioned Naisargika \\n\\nBala because it is always the same in every birth chart. The following table shows \\n\\nhow much strength is required for the various planets to be declared strong:\\n\\nPlanet \\n\\nSthan  Dik  Chesta  Kala  Ayana  Total \\n\\nRS  RS  RS \\n\\nRS  RS \\n\\nRS \\n\\n2-45  0-35  0-50 \\nSun \\n2-13  0-50  0-30 \\nMoon \\nMars \\n1-16  0-30  0-40 \\nMercury  2-45  0-35  0-50 \\nJupiter  2-45  0-35  0-50 \\n2-13  0-50  0-30 \\nVenus \\n1-36  0-30  0-40 \\nSaturn \\n\\n1-52  0-30 \\n1-40  0-40 \\n1-7 \\n0-20 \\n1-52  0-30 \\n1-52  0-30 \\n1-40  0-40 \\n0-20 \\n1-7 \\n\\n6-32 \\n5-53 \\n4-13 \\n6-32 \\n6-32 \\n5-53 \\n4-13 \\n\\n24. To ascertain the strength of the Lagna and other house add one Rupa to \\n\\nthe strength of the lord of the Bhava concerned. Further add to them the Dik Bala \\n\\nand Drig Bala of that house. The sum total would be the Bhava Bala required.\\n\\nNotes: If the Bhava is aspected or associated with its lord, Jupiter. Venus or \\n\\nMercury or be aspected by Jupiter or Mercury, the strength so obtained should also \\n\\nbe taken into account in determining the strength of a house (See verse 6 of this \\n\\nChapter).\\n\\nThus  ends   the   fourth   chapter   on   \"Determination   of   Shadabalas\"   in  \\n\\nPhaladeeplka composed by Mantreswara.\\n\\n50\\n\\n \\n\\x0cChapter 5\\n\\nSource of livelihood\\n\\n1. Which planet helps to acquire wealth? Which planet is in the 10th to the \\n\\nLagna or Moon whoever is stronger? The source of acquisition of wealth will be \\n\\nfather if the planet be the Sun. mother if the planet be the Moon, an enemy in case \\n\\nof Mars, a friend in case of Mercury, a brother in case of Jupiter, a wife in case of \\n\\nVenus and a servant in case of Saturn.\\n\\nThe profession of the native will be that assigned to the lord of the Navamsa \\n\\noccupied by the lord of the 10th house from the Lagna, from the Moon and the Sun \\n\\n(severally) whoever is the strongest.\\n\\nNotes — It will be seen in the verse that the source of acquisition of wealth \\n\\nhas been limited to relations and some other persons. In ancient times when this \\n\\nwork   was   written,   the   sources   of   income   were   limited.   In   modern   times   the \\n\\nsituation is quite different. For example, it is stated that in case of the Sun the \\n\\naccrual   of   wealth   could   be   from   father.   No   doubt,   the   Sun   governs   and   is \\n\\nsignificator   should   be   taken   into   consideration   for   determining   the   source   of \\n\\nincome. The same could apply to other planets. For example, if there be a strong \\n\\nMoon in the 10th from the lagna. the income can be predicted from white coloured \\n\\narticles (milk, pearls, silk, white clothes etc.), from articles coming out of water, \\n\\nfrom silver, from business with foreign lands etc.\\n\\nFor the other part of the verse we will try to explain its meaning through a \\n\\nchart.\\n\\nThe Lagna is Leo. The Sun is in Scorpio. The Moon is in Pisces. Taurus is \\n\\nthe sign 10th to the Lagna. Suppose the lord of this house Venus is in Libra 5 \\n\\ndegrees. Then Venus would be in Scorpio Navamsas in Libra. The Navamsa of \\n\\nScorpio   falls   between   3°-30\\'   to   6°-40\\'.  The   lord   of   Scorpio   Navamsa   is   Mars. \\n\\nTherefore, we will take that the source of livelihood (profession) would be in any \\n\\nof the significations of Mars.\\n\\n51\\n\\n\\x0cMoon\\n\\nLag.\\n\\nSun\\n\\nMerc.\\n\\nJup.\\n\\nIf the Sun be the strongest Leo will be the 10th sign and its lord is the Sun. \\n\\nSuppose   the   Sun   is   in   Scorpio-26   degrees,   he   will   be   in  Aquarius   navamsa \\n\\n(because Aquarius Navamsa falls in 23°-20\\' to 26°-40\\' of Aquarius). Saturn will, \\n\\nthus, be the lord of the Navamsa of the Sun. Therefore the sources of livelihood \\n\\nwill be in accordance with any of the characteristics and significations of Saturn.\\n\\nIf the Moon be stronger than the Lagna and the Sun, Sagittarius will be the \\n\\nsign 10th to the Moon whose lord is Jupiter. If Jupiter is in 15 degrees of Virgo, he \\n\\nwill be in Taurus Navamsa (because in Virgo, Taurus Navamsa falls in 13°-20\\' to \\n\\n16°-40\\'). The lord of this Navamsa is Venus. Therefore, the sources of livelihood \\n\\nwill be in accordance with the characteristics and significations of Venus.\\n\\nA  question   arises   why   should   only   the   lord   of   the   10th   house   from   the \\n\\nLagna, the Sun and the Moon Whoever be the strongest, should be considered and \\n\\nwhy not assessment should be made from all the three Vis., the lord of the Lagna, \\n\\nlord of the Moon sign and the lord of the Sun sign. Many learneds are of the view \\n\\nthat equal importance should be given to all the three lords because there are some \\n\\nwho have only one source of income while others have varied sources of income.\\n\\n2. The sources of livelihood of the native will be through fruit bearing trees, \\n\\nby the recitation of mantras, by fraud and cunningness, by gambling, by speaking \\n\\nlies,   through   wool,   medicines   and   the   like,   by   working   on   metals   or   through \\n\\nservice under a king or respectable person, if the lord of the 10th house be placed \\n\\n52\\n\\n\\x0cin the Navamsa of the Sun.\\n\\n3.   The   sources   of   income   or   livelihood   will   be   through   trade   in   water-\\n\\nproducts (pearls, corals etc.), agriculture and cattle breeding, pilgrimage to holy \\n\\nplaces, service under a woman and trade in drapery. If the Navamsa occupied by \\n\\nthe lord of the 10th house is that of the Moon.\\n\\n4. The sources of income or livelihood will be through metals, serving for \\n\\nfighting   battles,   cooking,   lands,   gold,   causing   troubles   to   others,   weapons, \\n\\nadventure, association with wicked men, spying or through theft if the lord of the \\n\\n10th house occupies the Navamsa of Mars.\\n\\n5. In a nativity where the lord of the 10th house is posited in the Navamsa \\n\\nowned by Mercury, the earning will be through composition of poem, study of \\n\\nsacred  scripture,  by  being  a  writer, or  through  clerical   work   or  through  tricks, \\n\\nthrough the knowledge of astrology, through the study of Vedas, by recitation of \\n\\nMantras, through priesthood or by some pretext.\\n\\n6. If the Navamsa be that of Jupiter, the sources of livelihood or earning will \\n\\nbe through dependence on Brahmins, or through dependence on temples (serving \\n\\nas   priests   etc.)   or   religious   Ashramas,   through   the   beneficience   of   the   king \\n\\n(Government), through study of Puranas, Shastras, or Vedas, through practicing of \\n\\nrighteous paths and actions, or by religious instruction.\\n\\n7. If the Navamsa be that of Venus, the sources of earning will be through \\n\\ndependence, serving a woman (she may be wife, prostitute, queen, a film actress or \\n\\nany   other   woman),   through   cows,   buffaloes,   elephants,   horses,   etc.,   through \\n\\nteaching music or through musical performances, by singing or dancing, through \\n\\nsilver (sale and purchase), scents, milk, curd etc., ornaments, through silken and \\n\\nother expensive dress materials, by being a companion or aides of a lady of high \\n\\nstanding, or by his poetic talents.\\n\\n8. If the Navamsa be that of Saturn, the sources of income or livelihood, will \\n\\nbe through dealing in roots and fruits, by hard physical labour, through servants or \\n\\nmenials, rogues and through the earnings of men of low morality, through grains of \\n\\nbad   quality,   by   carrying   loads,   by   following   low   kind   of   professions,   through \\n\\n53\\n\\n\\x0csculpture, wooden materials, and by serving under a butcher.\\n\\n9. If the lord of Navamsa be strong, there will be accrual of wealth without \\n\\nany obstacle or exertion. If it be weak, very little earning may be expected. The \\n\\ncountry from which the accrual of wealth will be Indicated by the sign representing \\n\\nthe 10th house or the Navamsa occupied by the lord of the 10th house. If the sign \\n\\nbe occupied or aspected by its lord, the source of income will be found in his own \\n\\ncountry. The same will happen when the Navamsa occupied by the lord of the 10th \\n\\nhouse by a fixed sign. If the sign of the 10th house be occupied or aspected by \\n\\nplanet other than its lord, the person concerned will earn in the place other than his \\n\\nnative land.\\n\\nThus ends the fifth chapter an \"Profession & Livelihood\" in Phaladeepika  \\n\\ncomposed by Mantreswara.\\n\\n54\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 6\\n\\nYOGAS\\n\\n1. If Mars occupies Aries or Scorpio (his own signs), or Capricorn (his sign \\n\\nof exaltation), identical with a kendra, the yoga so formed is known as Ruchaka.\\n\\nIf Mercury occupies Gemini (his own sign) or Virgo (his sign of exaltation) \\n\\nidentical with a kendra, the Yoga so formed is called Bhadra Yoga.\\n\\nIf Jupiter occupies Sagittarius or Pisces (his own sign) or Cancer (his sign of \\n\\nexaltation)  identical  with a kendra, the Yoga arising from such a disposition is \\n\\nknown as Hamsa Yoga.\\n\\nIf  Venus   occupies  Taurus   or   Libra   (his   own  sign)   or   Pisces   (his   sign   of \\n\\nexaltation) identical with a kendra, the Yoga so formed is called Malavya Yoga.\\n\\nIf Saturn occupies Capricorn or Aquarius (his own sign) or Libra (his sign of \\n\\nexaltation), the Yoga so formed is known as Sasa Yoga.\\n\\nNates - These five Yogas have been named as Pancha Mahapurusha Yogas. \\n\\nJataka Parijata has defined these Yogas as under :-\\n\\n\"According   as   Mars,   Mercury,   Jupiter,   Venus   or   Saturn   possessing   the \\n\\ngreatest   strength   and   occupying   a   kendra   is   in   Moolatrikona,   Swakshetra   or \\n\\nSwochcha,   the   resulting   Rajayogas   will   be   named   Ruchaka,   Bhadra,   Hamsa, \\n\\nMalavya and Sasa the beautiful\"\\n\\nAccording to Saravali \"Venus, Mars, Saturn, Jupiter and Mercury remaining \\n\\nin   their  respective   own  houses  or   exaltation   signs,   identical   with   kendra   cause \\n\\nMalavya, Ruchaka, Sasa, Hamsa and Bhadra Yogas respectively\"\\n\\nBut it is imperative that Yogas will give the promised effects only when the \\n\\nLagna or the Moon and the Yoga forming planets are without blemish. In other \\n\\nwords they are vested with strength and are not associated with or in conjunction \\n\\nwith malefics, are not combust and not placed between malefics.\\n\\nAs the names of Yogas denote the presons with such Yogas at birth become \\n\\nMahapurushas or illustrious  persons. We have also found that the  many  of the \\n\\nnoted politicians and administrators had one or more of such yogas present in their \\n\\n55\\n\\n\\x0cbirth charts, some illustrative birth charts are given below :\\n\\n2. The person born in Ruchaka Yoga has a long face. He acquires wealth by \\n\\nperforming courageous deeds. He will be full of valour and powerful, will conquer \\n\\nhis enemies and will be arrogant. He will become famous by virtue of merits and \\n\\nwill be commander of an army and will be successful in all his ventures.\\n\\nThe   person   with   Bhadra   Yoga   at   birth   will   be   longlived.   He   will   be \\n\\nintelligent,   will   be   clean   (pure   thoughts   and   clean   body),   praised   by   learned \\n\\npersons, very rich and prosperous and eloquent in his speeches.\\n\\nMoon \\nSaturn\\n\\nMars\\n\\nKetu\\n\\nStalin\\n\\nJupiter\\n\\nRuchaka and \\nMalavya Yogas\\n\\nSun \\nRahu\\n\\nMercury\\n\\nVenus \\nLagna\\n\\n3. The person born with Hamsa Yoga at birth, will be a king, a high political \\n\\nor gvernment dignitary respected by good people. He will have in his hands and \\n\\nfeet marks of Conch, Lotus, Fish and Ankusha. His body will be beautiful, will eat \\n\\ndelicious food and will be virtuous.\\n\\nThe person born in MaJavya Yoga will have strong limbs, will be very rich, \\n\\nblessed with wife and children and good fortune. He will be prosperous, will enjoy \\n\\npleasures of life, will possess good vehicles and become renowned and learned. He \\n\\nwill have imperturbed senses.\\n\\n4. The person with Sasa Yoga at birth will be acclaimed by all, have good \\n\\nservants, will be strong, will be the head of a village or a king. He will be wicked \\n\\nby nature and will associate with women not his own. He will be inclined to use \\n\\n56\\n\\n\\x0cother\\'s wealth and will be happy.\\n\\nThese five yogas reckoned from the Lagna as well as from the Moon and \\n\\nwill be found effective from both the places. They bestow on the native an empire \\n\\nand perfection. The person with one such yoga will be fortunate, with two such \\n\\nyogas will be equal to a king, with three he will be a king, four such yogas will \\n\\nmake   him   a   sovereign   of   sovereigns   (Emperor)   and   with   five   such   yogas   the \\n\\nperson will be superior to an Emperor.\\n\\nDr. Radha \\nKrishnan\\n\\nKetu\\n\\nRahu \\nVenus\\n\\nSun \\nMoon\\n\\nMars\\n\\nMercury\\nJupiter \\nSaturn\\n\\nMoon\\n\\nSun \\nMercury \\nVenus\\n\\nMars\\n\\nKetu\\n\\nMoti Lal Nehru\\n\\nHamsa Yoga\\n\\nLagna\\nJupiter\\n\\nSaturn\\n\\nRahu\\n\\n5. Three yogas, viz, Sunapha, Anapha and Durudhara are formed when the \\n\\n57\\n\\n\\x0cplanets occupy the 2nd and 12th houses reckoned from the Moon. There will be \\n\\nKemadruma yoga if the above three Yogas are absent. Some learneds are of the \\n\\nopinion that there will be Kemadruma Yoga if (1) When a Kendra or the Moon is \\n\\nassociated with a planet (2) When there is a planet in a Kendra from the Moon.\\n\\nNotes — According to Saravali Kemadruma Yoga is formed if at least one of \\n\\nthe said three yogas (viz., Sunapha, Anapha and Durudhara) is not present or if the \\n\\nMoon\\'s angles (Kendras) are devoid of angles or if she is unaspected by all the \\n\\nplanets. Such yoga causes extreme difficulties.\\n\\nRahu\\n\\nJawahar Lal \\nNehru\\n\\nMoon\\n\\nMalavya Yoga\\n\\nSaturn\\n\\nJupiter\\nKetu\\n\\nSun\\n\\nMercury\\nVenus\\n\\nMars\\n\\nAccording to Hora Sara (an ancient treatise on Astrology by Prithuyasas) the \\n\\nAnapha, Sunapha and Durudhara Yogas will not put to effect  if the Moon\\'s or \\n\\nLagna\\'s   angles   are   not   occupied.   In   such   case,   the   Yoga   arising   is   called \\n\\nKemadruma which makes even a king beg. To explain this further it may be said \\n\\nthat for obtaining Kemadruma, the Moon should not have a planet on either side or \\n\\nwith   it.   The   Sun\\'s   presence   and   of   course   that   of   nodes,   will   not   nullify   the \\n\\nKemadruma Yoga. But if there is a planet in any of the Moon angles or from the \\n\\nangles of Lagna, or if the Moon herself angular to the Lagna, the Kemadruma Yoga \\n\\ndoes not exist.\\n\\n58\\n\\n\\x0cRahu\\n\\nLagna Moon\\n\\nSardar Patel\\n\\nSasa and \\nRuchaka Yogas\\n\\nMars \\nSaturn\\n\\nSun\\nMerc.\\nJup.Ven\\n\\nKetu\\n\\nThere are other kinds of Kemadruma Yogas mentioned in Jataka Parijata \\n\\nwhich are as follows :-\\n\\n(1) The Moon in Lagna or the 7th but not aspected by Jupiter.\\n\\n(2) All the planets devoid of strength and less Bindus in Ashtakavarga.\\n\\n(3) The Moon in case of a night birth if in fall or in enemy\\'s Rasi/Navamsa \\n\\nand aspected by the 10th lord.\\n\\n(4) The Moon in Scorpio Navamsa joining a malefic and aspected by Lagna \\n\\nlord.\\n\\n(5) The waning Moon in Neecha Rasi for a night birth. As regards Anapha, \\n\\nSunapha and Durudhara Yogas according to Saravali by all possible permutations \\n\\nand transmutations, one can see 30 kinds of Sunapha yoga, 30 kinds of Anapha and \\n\\n180 kinds of Durudhara yogas. For details please consult English translation and \\n\\ncommentary of Saravali published by Ranjan Publications.\\n\\n6. The person with Sunapha Yoga at birth will be a monarch or his equal \\n\\nwith self acquired property and respected and renounced for his intellectual ability \\n\\nand riches. The person born with Anapha Yoga will be powerful, will enjoy good \\n\\nhealth   and   will   have   sweet   temperament.   He   will   be   famous   and   all   worldly \\n\\ncomforts will be available to him. He will be well dressed contented and happy.\\n\\n7. The native with Durudhara Yoga will enjoy all comforts of life as may \\n\\nbecome available to a ruler and will own abundant wealth and vehicles. He will be \\n\\n59\\n\\n\\x0cgenerous and will be attended to by faithful servants.\\n\\nOne born under Kemadruma Yoga even if he belongs to a royal family, will \\n\\nbecome unknown and will lead a miserable life. He will be addicted to immoral \\n\\nways, will face poverty, will be a menial and will be wickedly disposed.\\n\\n8. If benefic planets other than the Moon (and the nodes) are posited in the \\n\\n2nd, the 12th and both the Bhavas from the Sun, the Yogas so formed are known as \\n\\nSubhavesi,   Subhavasi   and   Subhobhayachari   respectively.   But   if   the   planets \\n\\nforming the Yogas are malefics, the yogas so formed are called Papavesi, Papavasi, \\n\\nand Papobhayachari respectively.\\n\\nWhen the 12th and 2nd from the Lagna are occupied by benefics, the Yoga \\n\\nso formed is called  Subhakartari.  If these houses are occupied  by malefics the \\n\\nresultant yoga is called Papakartari.\\n\\nIf benefics without being aspected by malefics occupy the 2nd house from \\n\\nthe Lagna, the Yoga so arising is known as Susubha.\\n\\nNotes   —   In   most   of   the   authoritative   works   of   Hindu   Astrology \\n\\ndifferendation   lias   been   made   between   malefics   and   benefics   in   forming \\n\\nSubhavesi, Subhavasi and Subhobhayachari Yogas. According to them —\\n\\n(1) The yoga is called Subhavesi if amongst Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus \\n\\nand Saturn, any of them is in the 2nd to the Sun.\\n\\n(2) The Yoga is known as Subhavasi if any amongst the planets mentioned \\n\\nabove is in the 12th to the Sun.\\n\\n(3) If any or more of the above planets are in the 2nd and 12th the Yoga is \\n\\nknown as Ubhayachari Yoga.\\n\\nBut as will be seen from verse 8, Shri Mantreswara has made a definite and \\n\\nclear   distinction   between   the  Yogas   formed   by   benefics   and   those   formed   by \\n\\nmalefics. We feel that Mantreswara\\'s views are very logical and therefore correct.\\n\\n9.  The   person   with   Subhavesi  Yoga   at   birth   will   be   very   good   looking, \\n\\nhappy, meritorious, valiant, a king and virtuous. The person with Subhavasi Yoga \\n\\nwill be renowned, dear to all, and very rich and prosperous. He will be governed \\n\\nand will be liked by the king. The native having Subhobhayachari Yoga in his birth \\n\\n60\\n\\n\\x0cchart will have an attractive body, will be soft spoken, will delight the world, will \\n\\nbe eloquent, renowned and wealthy.\\n\\n10. The person with Asubhavesi Yoga at birth will unfairly defame others, \\n\\nwill not be beautiful and will move in the company of low and wicked people. The \\n\\nperson with Asubhavasi Yoga will be dishonest, harsh and abusive in speech and \\n\\nwill   associate   with   wicked   people.   He   will   be   unvirtuous   though   he  will   have \\n\\nknowledge of Shastras and Scriptures. The person born in Asubhobhayachari yoga \\n\\nwill suffer mentally due to dishonour in public and will be devoid of wealth and \\n\\nfortune.\\n\\n11. Subhakartari Yoga at birth will make a person longlived, fearless, healthy \\n\\nand without enemies. Papakartari Yoga will make the person miserable, bereft of \\n\\nwife and children. He will have defective limbs and will have a short life.\\n\\nNotes   —   Saravali   which   makes   no   differences   between   Subhavesi   and \\n\\nSubhavasi and Asubhavesi and Asubhavasi Yogas has given effects of different \\n\\nplanets   forming   Vesi   and   Vasi   and   Ubhayachari  Yogas.  According   to   Saravali \\n\\nshould Jupiter cause Vesi Yoga, the native will accumulate money, be learned and \\n\\nbe good-treated. If Venus produces this yoga, the person will be timid, will face \\n\\nobstacles   in   his   missions,   will   have   pleasant   (swift)   movements   and   will   be \\n\\ndefeated. Mercury\\'s participation Indicates that native will be a servant, will suffer \\n\\npenury, be soft-spoken and be modest. He will be bashful. Mars denotes that native \\n\\nwill resort to base means but will be helpful to others. If it is Saturn that causes \\n\\nvesi yoga, one will join others\\' wives, will be wicked, will resemble an old person \\n\\nin appearence,  will  be fraudulent  in disposition and be contemptuous. He will, \\n\\nhowever, have wealth.\\n\\nIf Jupiter should cause vasi yoga, the native will possess courage, strength \\n\\nand  wisdom.   He   keeps   up   his   word.   In   the   case   of  Venus,   the   person   will   be \\n\\nvalorous, famous, virtuous and reputed. Mercury emanating this Yoga will make \\n\\none speak sweetly. He will be beautiful and will obey other\\'s orders. The Vasi Yoga \\n\\ncaused by Mars indicates that the subject will be victorious in war, will be famous \\n\\nand   will   own   fortunes.   If   the   Yoga   is   caused   by   Saturn,   the   native   will   be \\n\\n61\\n\\n\\x0cbusinessman, wicked, will steel others\\' money, will hate elders and will be husband \\n\\nof a pious woman.\\n\\n12. The person born with Amala Yoga at birth will be virtuous, will have \\n\\nfaith in religion, will be happy, fortunate, will be honoured by the king, have an \\n\\namiable nature and will always have a smile on his face.\\n\\nNotes — Amala Yoga is formed when there is a benefic planet in the 10th. \\n\\nhouse from the Lagna or the Moon.\\n\\n13. The effects of Susubha, Subha Kartari and Subha Vest and other Yogas \\n\\nwould be the same as they are caused by benefics in case of Suhapha and other \\n\\nYogas. The reverse would be the effects in case of Asubha, Papakartari and other \\n\\nYogas caused by malefics.\\n\\n14. Mahabhagya Yoga is caused In the case of a male if the birth is during \\n\\nthe day (between sunrise and sunset). If the Ascendant, the Sun and the Moon are \\n\\nIn odd signs (viz., Aries, Gemini, Leo. Libra, Sagittarius, and Aquarius).\\n\\nMahabhagya Yoga will arise in the case of a female if the birth is during the \\n\\nnight time (after sunset and before sunrise) when the Ascendant, the Sun and the \\n\\nMoon   are   in   even   signs   (viz.,   Taurus,   Cancer,   Virgo,   Scorpio.   Capricorn   and \\n\\nPisces). In this connection see the horoscope of Indira Gandhi who was born at \\n\\nnight.\\n\\nKesari Yoga is caused when in a birth chart the Moon is in a Kendra position \\n\\nto Jupiter.\\n\\nThe Moon in the 12th, 8th or 6th house from Jupiter causes Sakata Yoga. \\n\\nThe   Sakata  Yoga   is   cancelled   if   the   Moon   be   in   a   Kendra   position   from   the \\n\\nAscendant (lagna).\\n\\n62\\n\\n\\x0cJupiter\\n\\nKetu\\n\\nLagna\\nSaturn\\n\\nMars\\n\\nMoon\\n\\nVenus\\nRahu\\n\\nSun \\nMercury\\n\\nThe  Adhama,   Sama   and  Varishtha  Yogas   are   formed   when   the   Moon   is \\n\\nrespectvely in a Kendra, a Panaphara and an Apoklima house reckoned from the \\n\\nSun.\\n\\n15. The person with Mahabhagya Yoga will be immensely popular In the \\n\\npublic,   will   be   very   generous   in   giving   gifts   and   will   possess   a   very   high \\n\\nreputation. He will be a ruler of the earth, will have a life span of 80 years and will \\n\\nbe   of   spotless   character.   A  female   born   with   this   Yoga   will   be   exceedingly \\n\\nfortunate and possess sweet manners.\\n\\nNotes — In the case of Shrimati Indira Gandhi whose horoscope we have \\n\\ngiven above, all the above effects were experienced by her in her life time except \\n\\nthat   her   husband   was   longlived.   That   was   due   to   other   adverse   planetary \\n\\ndispositions in her horoscope.\\n\\n16. The person with Kesari Yoga will destroy his enemies like a lion. He will \\n\\naddress assembly with wisdom and in a noble manner. He will be passionate and \\n\\nemotional   in   his   behaviour.   He   will   enjoy   a   long   life   and   will   attain   a   high \\n\\nreputation and will be intelligent. He will achieve every thing by his own valour.\\n\\n17. The person with Sakata Yoga at birth will be unhappy and unfortunate. \\n\\nHe will be unable to achieve any fame and will lead an ordinary life. Sometimes \\n\\nhis luck dawns and at other times it fades away.\\n\\nThis is the horoscope of Pt. Jawahar Lal Nehru. There is Sakata Yoga as the \\n\\n63\\n\\n\\x0cMoon is in the 6th house from Jupiter but Sakata Yoga gets concelled as the Moon \\n\\nis in a Kendra from the Lagna (in the Lagna itself).\\n\\nRahu\\n\\nLagna\\nMoon\\n\\nSaturn\\n\\nJupiter\\nKetu\\n\\nSun\\n\\nVenus \\nMercury\\n\\nMars\\n\\n18.   The   person   born   with   Varishta  Yoga,   will   be   wealthy,   will   possess \\n\\nvehicles, will achieve fame, will enjoy happiness, will acquire knowledge and will \\n\\nhave intellectual equipment, modesty, ability, learning and will be generous. The \\n\\neffects will be of a medium nature in Sama Yoga and very little in Adhama Yoga.\\n\\n19. Vasumati Yoga is formed when all the benefic planets occupy upachaya \\n\\nhouses (3, 6, 10, 11) from the Lagna or the Moon.\\n\\nAmala yoga is formed when benefics occupy the 10th house reckoned from \\n\\nthe Lagna or the Moon.\\n\\nIf the lords of the signs occupied by the Lagna and the Moon be together in a \\n\\nKendra or be in the house of an Adhimitra and a planet endowed with strength \\n\\naspects the Lagna, the planetary disposition so formed is known as Pushkala yoga.\\n\\n20. The person born with Vasumati yoga will always remain at his house \\n\\n(perhaps this means that he will not go out of his native land) and he will be very \\n\\nwealthy.\\n\\nThe person born with Amala yoga will possess lands, will be wealthy, will \\n\\nbe blessed with sons and will be famous, prosperous and wise.\\n\\nThe native of Pushkala yoga will be reverred by kings, will be renowned and \\n\\n64\\n\\n\\x0cwealthy and will wear expensive clothes and ornaments. He will be fortunate, will \\n\\nbe a lord of many men and achieve a high status.\\n\\n21. If all the planets in regular order are in the 5th, 6th and 7th houses, the \\n\\nyoga is known as Subnamala. If the planets should occupy the 8th, 6th and 12th \\n\\nhouses, the yoga will become Asubhamala.\\n\\nIf Venus and the lord of 9th occupy their own or exaltation houses identical \\n\\nwith Trikona or Kendra, the yoga so formed is called Lakshmi Yoga. If the Moon \\n\\nbe in his own or exaltation house identical with Kendra or Trikona and be aspected \\n\\nby Jupiter, the resulting Yoga is called Gouri Yoga.\\n\\n22. The person with Sumala Yoga at birth will be an administrator or high \\n\\nofficial, will be reverred by king and will indulge in pleasures of life. He will be \\n\\ngenerous, will be helpful to others and will be devoted to his kinsmen. He will be \\n\\nbrave and will be blessed with a virtuous wife and sons.\\n\\n23.

The native with Lakshmi Yoga will be constantly engaged in enjoyment \\n\\nwith a woman of noble temperament. He will be brilliant. He will be capable of \\n\\nproviding protection to his men and will be a favourite of Goddess Lakshmi (very \\n\\nwealthy).   He   will   be   free   from   diseases.   He   will   enjoy   rides   in   beautiful \\n\\npalanquines,   horses   or   elephants   (He   will   have   the   privilege   of   travelling   in \\n\\nluxurious conveyances). He will be generous in gifts and will be a capable ruler \\n\\nfavourite of his subjects.\\n\\n25. The native with Gouri Yoga will have a beautiful body and will be a \\n\\nfriend of the king. He will possess good qualities and will be blessed with sons. He \\n\\nwill belong to an illustrious family. His face will be like a lotus. He will be praised \\n\\nfor his successes (over enemies).\\n\\n26-27. If Mercury, Jupiter and Venus be in Kendra or Trikona from the lagna \\n\\nor be in the 2nd house and Jupiter be in his own sign, friend s sign or in his sign of \\n\\nexaltation,   the   planetary   combination   so   formed   is   called   Saraswati   yoga.  The \\n\\n65\\n\\n\\x0choroscope of Moti Lai Nehru illustrates Saraswati Yoga.\\n\\nMoon\\n\\nMars\\n\\nKetu\\n\\nLagna\\nJupiter\\n\\nSaturn\\n\\nSun \\nMercury \\nVenus\\n\\nRahu\\n\\nIn this Jupiter, Mercury and Venus are in Kendra and Jupiter with Digbala is \\n\\nexalted in Lagna, forming a perfect Saraswati Yoga.\\n\\nThe Native with Saraswati Yoga at bith will be highly Intelligent.

If the Lord of the Lagna. the Sun and the Moon being in their sign of \\n\\nexaltation,   own   sign   or   a   friend\\'s   sign,   occupy   kendra   or   trikona,   the   yoga   so \\n\\nformed is called Srikantha Yoga.\\n\\nIf Venus, the lord of the 9th and Mercury be in similar position, the yoga \\n\\nformed is known as Srinatha Yoga.\\n\\nIf Jupiter, the lord of the 5th and Saturn be similarly disposed, the yoga so \\n\\nformed is termed as Virinrhi Yoga.\\n\\n29. The person with Srikantha Yoga at birth will wear Rudraksha rosaries \\n\\nand his body will look white shining by besmearing the sacred ashes.

When two lords of different houses mutually interchange places, that is, \\n\\nthey occupy the house of each other, such a disposition of planets is known as \\n\\nParivartana yoga. The interchanges of the pairs of the bhava lords will number 66 \\n\\nbeginning from the Lagna and ending with the 12th. Out of these 66 parivartana \\n\\nYogas, 30 are caused by the lords of the 6th, 8th and 12th and are called Dalnya \\n\\nyogas. 8 such Parivartana Yogas are caused by the lord of the 3rd and are termed as \\n\\nKahala yogas.

He   will   hold   a   high   position   and   will   be \\n\\nrewarded of authority by the king, He will be blessed with sons and fully enjoy \\n\\nwealth and conveyances.\\n\\nHere is the horoscope of Smt. Indira Gandhi. Here there are interchanges of \\n\\nhouses: —\\n\\n(1) The lord of the Lagna is in the 7th and the lord of the 7th is in the Lagna.\\n\\n(2) The lord of the 2nd is in the 5th and the lord of the 5th is in the 2nd.\\n\\n(3) The lord of the 11th is in the 6th and the lord of the 6th is in the 11th.\\n\\nJupiter\\n\\nKetu\\n\\nLagna \\nSaturn\\n\\nMars\\n\\nMoon\\n\\nRahu \\nVenus\\n\\nSun \\nMercury\\n\\n(1) and (2) are Maha Yogas and (3) is Dainya Yoga The effects of these \\n\\nYogas were fully realised by the native in her life.\\n\\nNotes - Here it would be relevant to mention that in khand 4 sloka 22 in \\n\\nUttarakalamrit, the exalted results given for mutual interchange of lords of the 6th, \\n\\n8th and 12th houses are quite reverse of the effects given in Phaladeepika. The \\n\\nsloka in Uttarakalamrit is as under.\\n\\nThis means that (1) If the lord of the 8th is in the 12th or 6th, (2) if the lord \\n\\nof the 6th is in the 8th or 12th. (3) if the lord of the 12th is in the 8th or 6th. (4) the \\n\\nthree lords may be in the signs of each other or be aspected by each other and (5) if \\n\\n70\\n\\n\\x0cthey are not associated with or aspected by the lords of any other houses (in other \\n\\nwords they may have nothing to do with the lords of any other houses), the person \\n\\nborn in such a Yoga will be very prosperous and a king of kings.\\n\\nThis is known as Vipareeta Raja Yoga which means that the planets who \\n\\nnormally give adverse effect, give excellent results.\\n\\nHowever, there is some difference between the Yogas given above and those \\n\\nmentioned in Phaladeepika. In Phaladeepika Dainya Yogas (by the lords of the 6th, \\n\\n8th and 12th) are caused by interchanges of two planets only amongst the lords of \\n\\nthe 6th, 8th and 12th, while in Uttarkalamrita the effects are given of the placement \\n\\nof the lords of the 6th, 8th and 12th in Dusthanas or of their association with or \\n\\naspect by each other and be unrelated top lords of any other houses.\\n\\nLagna\\n\\nSun\\n\\nMars\\n\\nSaturn\\n\\n35. Note in the birth chart where the lord of the Lagna is posited, and where \\n\\nthe lord of the sign occupied by the lord of Lagna is placed. If the lord of this sign \\n\\nis in his sign of exaltation or own identical with kendra or trikona, the Yoga so \\n\\nformed is termed as Kahala Yoga See this birth chart as an example.\\n\\nIn this example horoscope lord of the Lagna is Mars. He is in Leo (5th \\n\\nhouse) Lord of 5th house (Leo) the Sun is in the 1 It in Aquarius. Saturn, the lore, \\n\\nof Aquarius, is in 7th a kendra, in his own sign of exaltation. This is how Kahala \\n\\nYoga is formed.\\n\\n71\\n\\n\\x0cIf the lord of the sign in which the Lord of Lagna is posited, be in his sign of \\n\\nexaltation, of own sign identical with kendra or trikona, the Yoga so arising is \\n\\nknown as Parvata Yoga.\\n\\nIn   this   example   horoscope   the   lord   of   the   Lagna.   Mars   is   posited   in \\n\\nSagittarius (9th house). Lord of the 9th house Jupiter is in the 4th (a Kendra) in his \\n\\nsign of exaltation causing Parvata Yoga.\\n\\nLagna\\n\\nJupiter\\n\\nMars\\n\\n36.  The   person   with   Kahala   Yoga   at   birth   will   be   prosperous,   noble, \\n\\nbenevolent, kind and propitious. He will be very popular in the public.\\n\\nThe person born with Parvata Yoga will always be wealthy and happy. He \\n\\nWill perfrom acts which will afford by lasting benefit to others (like construction \\n\\nof Dharmashalas, hospitals, temples, reservoirs, etc.). He will become the ruler of \\n\\nthe Earth.\\n\\n72\\n\\n\\x0cSun \\nRahu\\n\\nVen \\nMars \\nMercury\\n\\nL\\n\\nJup\\n\\nMoon \\nKetu\\n\\nSat\\n\\nThis is the horoscope of Shri Morarji Desai former Prime Minister of India. \\n\\nThe Lord of the Lagna Mercury is in Capricorn (8th House). The Lord of the 8th \\n\\nhouse Saturn is exalted in the 5th causing Parvata Yoga.\\n\\n37. The conjunction or association of the lords of 9th and the 10th house in \\n\\nany auspicious house consitutes Raja Yoga.\\n\\nIf   the   lords   of   a   Kendra   and  Trikona   are   similarly   placed   (that   is,   they \\n\\noccupy together an auspicious house), the Yoga so formed is called Shankha Yoga.\\n\\n38. The person with Raja yoga will be a king or equal to a king. When sets \\n\\nout on a journey he will be greeted by bands like Bheri and sounds of Conch etc. \\n\\nHe   will   have   a   Royal   Umbrella   over   his   head   and   will   be   accompanied   by \\n\\nelephants, horses, and palanquins etc. Bards and minstrels will recite poems in his \\n\\npraise, He will be presented gifts by eminent persons.\\n\\nThe person born with Shankha Yoga will enjoy all comforts in the company \\n\\nof many beautiful women.\\n\\n39-41 (1) When the seven planets from Sun to Saturn occupy seven separate \\n\\nsigns the Yoga so arising is known as Vallaki. This is also called Veena Yoga. The \\n\\nperson   born   in   this  Yoga   is   fond   of   dancing,   singing   and   playing   on   musical \\n\\ninstrumets and is wealthy.\\n\\n(2) When all the seven planets are in six signs, they form Dharma Yoga. The \\n\\nperson born with this Yoga will be generous, a king and benefactor.\\n\\n73\\n\\n\\x0c(3) When all the seven Planets are confined to five signs only, they give rise \\n\\nto Hasha Yoga. The person born with this Yoga indulges in enjoyment of life, is \\n\\nwealthy and of good conduct and has relatives.\\n\\n(4)  When   all   the   seven   planets   are   placed   in   four   signs   only,   they   form \\n\\nKendra   Yoga.   The   person   with   this   yoga   at   birth   will   acquire   wealth   and \\n\\nagricultural lands.\\n\\n(5) When all the planets are disposed in three signs only, the resulting yoga \\n\\nis known as Shula Yoga. The person with this yoga at birth is wrathful, of violent \\n\\ndisposition and poor.\\n\\n(6) If all the seven planets are posited in two signs only, they give rise to \\n\\nYuga  Yoga.  The  person with  this Yoga In  his birth  chart  will  be heretical  and \\n\\nwithout wealth.\\n\\n(7) If all the seven planets are disposed in one sign, they form Gola Yoga. \\n\\nThe person born with this Yoga will be Indolent, shortlived, without wealth, sinful \\n\\nand will associate with low type of persons. Such a person will not be a skillful \\n\\nartisan.\\n\\n42. When the benefic planets occupy the 6th, 7th and 8th places from the \\n\\nLagna or the Moon, the Yoga so formed is called Adhiyoga.\\n\\nThe person born with Adhiyoga is a commander (Superintendent of Police \\n\\nor Commander of an army), a minister or a ruler (of a District or State). He will be \\n\\nrenowned, prosperous, wealthy, longlived and large souled.\\n\\nThis is the horoscope of Sardar Patel. In this Mercury, Jupiter and Venus are \\n\\nin the 7th from the Lagna and in the 6th from the exalted Moon.\\n\\nThere is both Lagnadhiyoga and Chandradhiyoga.\\n\\n74\\n\\n\\x0cRahu\\n\\nL\\n\\nMoon\\n\\nMars\\nSat\\n\\nSun \\nMerc\\nJup Ven\\n\\nKetu\\n\\nNotes— Some authors are of the view that for the Adhiyoga (from the Moon \\n\\nor the Lagna) all the three houses viz.,\\'the 6th, 7th and 8th should be occupied by \\n\\nMercury, Jupiter or Venus. None of them should be vacant but this is not correct. \\n\\nShruti   Kirti   has   pronounced   that   according   to   Vyas   and   other   ancient   sages \\n\\nMercury, Jupiter and Venus may be separately In the three houses or two may be in \\n\\none house and the third may be in any other house (amongst 6,7 and 8) and all the \\n\\nthree may be together in any of these three houses to meet the requirements of \\n\\nthese three houses to form this yoga.\\n\\n43. The further effects of the Adhiyoga are that the native will become lord \\n\\nof men, will always be wealthy, will have a large number of kinsmen and whom he \\n\\nwill feed and will be victorious over his enemies.\\n\\n44-56. (1) benefics occupy or aspect the Lagna and the lord of Lagna not \\n\\nbeing combust be posited in an auspicious house in his sign of exaltation or own \\n\\nsign, the resulting planetary disposition is called Chamara Yoga. The person with \\n\\nthis yoga at birth grows (progresses) in prosperity like the Moon of the bright half \\n\\nof the month and well behaved. He is wealthy, renowned, longlived and lord of \\n\\nmen.\\n\\n(2) If the 2nd house is occupied or aspected by benefic planet and the lord of \\n\\n2nd  house  not  being  combust  is  posited   in   an  auspicious  house   in   his  sign   of \\n\\nexaltation or in his own sign, the resulting Yoga is Dhenu Yoga, the person born \\n\\n75\\n\\n\\x0cwith this yoga will be well equipped with gold, wealth, grains, and precious stones, \\n\\nand will be equal to king of kings.\\n\\n(3) If the third house is occupied or aspected by benefic planets and the lord \\n\\nof the third house not being combust, is in an auspicious house, in his sign of \\n\\nexaltation or in his own sign, the yoga so formed is known as Shaurya yoga.\\n\\nThe person born with Shaurya Yoga has younger brothers devoted to him. \\n\\nThe younger brothers will attain glory and will be brave and valiant and will be \\n\\nendowed with admiration of others. His nature will be adorned like Shri Rama, he \\n\\nwill be engrossed in state affairs, will be loved by everybody and will be very \\n\\nrenowned.\\n\\n(4) If the fourth house is similarly disposed the Yoga formed is known as \\n\\nJaladhi. The person born with this Yoga will be rich in cattle wealth and grains. He \\n\\nwill   own   a   beautifully   constructed   mansion   full   of   relatives.   He   will   have   an \\n\\nexcellent wife, gems, clothes, ornaments and will attain a high and respectable \\n\\nstatus.   He   will   be   blessed   with   everlasting   happiness.   He   will   own   elephants, \\n\\nhorses, palanquins etc., and will be reverred by the king. He will be devoted to \\n\\nBrahmins and gods and construct wells and reservoirs by the road side for the \\n\\nbenefit of others.\\n\\n(5) Similar disposition of the 5th house gives rise to Chhattra Yoga. The \\n\\nperson born with Chhattra yoga will lead a very happy family life, will be very \\n\\nfortunate and will enjoy happiness from children, will be wealthy and renowned \\n\\nwith eloquent speech. He will possess a sharp intellect and will become a minister \\n\\nof the king. He will be honoured by the king and will be respected by others.\\n\\n(6) Similar disposition of the 6th house causes Astra yoga. The person born \\n\\nwith Astra yoga will be capable of conquering very powerful enemies. He will be \\n\\ncruel in his disposition and arrogant. He will have bruised limbs but a strong body. \\n\\nHe will be quarrelsome.\\n\\nNotes — Normally the 6th house is treated as Dusthana (bad house); but if \\n\\nthe lord of the sixth be in the sixth, he improves the effects of the 6th house. It is \\n\\ngenerally said by the astrological pandits that malefics do good if they are posited \\n\\n76\\n\\n\\x0cin the 6th house. The reason for this can be that the 6th house is \\'Shatru sthana\\'. \\n\\nMalefics will destroy the enemies. It is also believed that Mars, Saturn and Rahu \\n\\nare good in the 3rd, 6th and 11th. The reason for this is also the same, namely, the \\n\\nmalefic will destroy enemies and diseases. Now we come to Shri Mantreshwarar\\'s \\n\\nviews. According to him the lord of a house gives good effects when he is vested \\n\\nwith strength. This is unobjectionable but he has also expressed the opinion that if \\n\\nlord of a Dusthana is posited in another dustnana he does good. This has been \\n\\ndescribed in Verse 57 of this very chapter. Another thing is that benefics do good to \\n\\nthe house where they are posited. Similarly the aspect of benefics improves the \\n\\neffects of the aspected house.\\n\\n(7) If there be similar disposition of the 7th house, the Yoga arising is called \\n\\nKama yoga. The person with Kama yoga at birth will have nothing to do with other \\n\\npeople\\'s wives. His good qualities will enable him to surpass his father and he will \\n\\nbe very prosperous.\\n\\n(8) With similar disposition of the 8th house, the yoga-formed is known as \\n\\nAstra yoga. The person with this yoga will disturb others in their work and will \\n\\nbecome a talebearer. He will be selfish, poor and have forbidden cravings. He will \\n\\nindulge in mean doings and will untimately suffer for his unwanted doings.\\n\\n(9) The 9th house disposed in the same manner gives rise to Bhagya Yoga. \\n\\nThe   person   who   has   his   birth   in   the   Bhagya   yoga   will   move   in   palanquins \\n\\n(excellent vehicles) in the midst of sounds of musical instruments (bands, drums \\n\\netc.) and with chowries waving to and fro. He will always be equipped with wealth \\n\\nand will observe a righteous code of conduct. Gods and Brahmins will be pleased \\n\\nwith him for his devotion and virtues. He win make his family illustrious and will \\n\\nhave a lowering disposition.\\n\\n(10) The disposition in similar manner in the 10th will cause Khyati Yoga. \\n\\nThe person born with Khayti yoga at his birth will become a king who will protect \\n\\nhis good subjects by following a code of conduct approved by all. He will have \\n\\nsons, friends, wife and will be very wealthy, prosperous and famous.\\n\\n(11) The disposition in the same way of the 11th will give rise to Parijata \\n\\n77\\n\\n\\x0cYoga. The person born with the Parijata Yoga will always be celebrating on some \\n\\naccount   or   other. He  will  become  a  king  and  will  also  be  the   owner   of  much \\n\\nhoarded wealth. He will have a large family and will be fond of hearing songs of \\n\\ngreat  people. He will be learned and always engaged in performing auspicious \\n\\nfunctions.\\n\\n(12) The 12th house so disposed will cause Musala Yoga. The person born \\n\\nwith   Musala  Yoga   will   accumulate   wealth   with   great   difficulty.   He   will   suffer \\n\\nhumiliation. His wealth will be tnstable. His expenditure will be only for legitimate \\n\\npurposes. He will be stupid and of unsteady mind and he will go to heaven after his \\n\\ndeath.\\n\\n57. If the lords of the houses from the Lagna onwards are in the 6th, 8th or \\n\\nthe 12th. or If the houses are occupied or aspected by malefics, 12 kinds of yogas \\n\\nare formed from the houses commencing from the Lagna. They are respectively—\\n\\n(1) Ava Yoga, (2) Nisswa Yoga, (3) Mriti Yoga, (4) Kuhu Yoga, (5) Pamara \\n\\nYoga, (6) Harsha Yoga, (7) Dushkriti Yoga, (8) Sarala Yoga, (9) Nirbhagya Yoga, \\n\\n(10) Duryoga,\\n\\n(11) Daridra Yoga, and (12) VimalaYoga.\\n\\n58. The person born with Ava yoga will be of no significance (He will be \\n\\nunknown and will be of no importance to others). He will be exceedingly poor and \\n\\nwill   have   a   short   life   (Alpa   ayu).   He   will   suffer   humiliations,   will   remain   in \\n\\ncompany of the wicked and will Be deformed and of ill behaviour. His position \\n\\nwill remain unsteady.\\n\\n59. The person with Nisswa yoga at birth will be harsh in speaking. His wife \\n\\nwill not bear children. He will remain in bad company and will have ill formed \\n\\nteeth and eyes. He will be bereft of intelligence, children, learning and power. His \\n\\nwealth will be taken away by his enemies.\\n\\n60. The person with Mriti Yoga will be annihilated by his enemies, will be \\n\\ndevoid of brothers, shame, strength and wealth. He will get tired by indulging in \\n\\nunseemly actions and will be of excitable temperament.\\n\\n61.   Kuhu  Yoga   will   make   the   native   be   bereft   of   mother,   conveyances, \\n\\n78\\n\\n\\x0cfriends,  happiness,  ornaments, relations.  He  will  be  unemployed and without  a \\n\\nplace of living having lost the one already owned by him and will have association \\n\\nwith women of low caste.\\n\\n62.   Pamara   Yoga   which   affects   the   5th   house,   will   give   the   native   a \\n\\nmiserable living and he will be indiscriminate. He will be liar and a cheat. He will \\n\\nsuffer from loss of children or will be childless. He will associate with mean and \\n\\nwicked persons. He will have no faith in God or religion and will be a glutton.\\n\\n63. Harsha Yoga concerns the 6th house. According to this yoga if the lords \\n\\nof the 6th, 8th and 12th occupy the 6th house, the native will be blessed with \\n\\nhappiness and good fortune and a strong constitution. He will conquer his enemies \\n\\nand will hesitate in indulging in sinful deeds. He will become a friend of illustrious \\n\\nand   men   with   class.   He   will   be   wealthy,   splendourous,   famous   and   will   have \\n\\nfriends and sons.\\n\\n64. Dushkriti Yoga involves the 7th house. The person with this yoga at \\n\\nbirth, will be deprived of his own wife and will indulge with other persons\\' wives. \\n\\nHe will wander about to and fro unnoticed and will suffer from venereal diseases. \\n\\nHe will be punished by the king (Government). He will be hated by his relations \\n\\nand will remain unhappy in consequence.\\n\\n65. Sarala Yoga concerns the 8th house. The yoga is formed if the lords of \\n\\nthe 6th, 8th or 12th are posited in the 8th house. This yoga inspite of the house \\n\\nbeing   a   Dusthana   gives   excellent   results.   The   yoga   enables   the   native   to   be \\n\\nlonglived. resolute, fearless, prosperous, learned, blessed with children and wealth. \\n\\nThe native with this yoga will achieve success in all his ventures, will be victorious \\n\\nover his enemies and will be a great celebrity.\\n\\n66.   The   Nirbhagya   Yoga   which   concerns   the   9th   house   (the   house   of \\n\\nBhagya) causes the native to lose all his paternal property such as lands, house etc. \\n\\nHe will have no regard for good people and elders and will be irreligious. He will \\n\\nbe dressed in old and worn out clothes, will be poor and miserable.\\n\\n67. All   the  physical   efforts   will   prove  fruitless   for  the   person  born   with \\n\\nDuryoga involving the 10th house. He will be of no importance, a traitor and very \\n\\n79\\n\\n\\x0cselfish only earning to satisfy his own hunger. He will be constantly away from his \\n\\nhome and live abroad.\\n\\n68. The yoga involving the 11th house is known as Daridrya Yoga. Incoming \\n\\ndebts constantly will be the way of life for the person with this yoga. He suffers \\n\\nfrom diseases of the ear. He will be deprived of good brotherhood and will be \\n\\nengaged in cruelly and sins. He will be indecent in speech and work like a menial.\\n\\n69. The person with his birth in Vlmla Yoga (which concerns the 12th house) \\n\\nwill be frugal in his expenses and clever in saving money. He will be equipped \\n\\nwith good behaviour towards others, will enjoy happiness, will be independent, \\n\\nwill follow a respectable profession or conduct and will be well known for his \\n\\ngood qualities.\\n\\nNotes — We would like to make some comments on the three yogas vis., \\n\\nHarsha, Sarala and Vimala involving the 6th, 8th, and 12th, the three Dusthanas or \\n\\ninauspicious houses of a horoscope. As will be seen irom verses 63, 65 and 69, if \\n\\nthe lords of these three houses are posited in their own houses or in any of the \\n\\nother two houses, they produce excellent results. Every planet In his own house is \\n\\ndeemed to be good and strong even if the house concerned is 6th, 8th or 12th; but \\n\\nhow is it that lord of an inauspicious house produces good resultes when he is \\n\\nposited in another inauspicious house. The reason given for such an opposite effect \\n\\nis that the lord of an inauspicious when disposed in another inauspicious becomes \\n\\nso weak that it loses its evil character and assumes the role of a strong benefic to \\n\\nenable him to produce excellent opposite results. Why these three yogas have been \\n\\ncalled   as   Vipareeta   Raja   Yogas?   As   stated   in   our   notes   on   verses   33-35 \\n\\nUttarakalamrit   supports   this   view;   but   Parashara   in   his   Brihat   Parashara   Bora \\n\\nShastra   has   accorded   no   recognition   to   this   yoga.   The   effects   given   there   of \\n\\ndisposition of the lords of the 6th, 8th and 12th in each other\\'s houses are described \\n\\nbelow :-\\n\\n(1) 6th lord in the 6th - The native will have enmity with the group of his \\n\\nkinsmen but. he will be friendly to others and will enjoy mediocre happiness in \\n\\nmatters like wealth.\\n\\n80\\n\\n\\x0c(2) 6th lord in the 8th - The native will be sickly, inimical, will desire others\\' \\n\\nwealth, be interested in other\\'s wives and be impure (or degraded).\\n\\n(3) 6th lord in the 12th - The native will always spend on vices, be hostile to \\n\\nlearned people and will torture living beings.\\n\\n(4) 8th lord in the 6th - The native will win over his enemies, be afflteted by \\n\\ndiseases and during childhood, will incure danger through snakes and water.\\n\\n(5) 8th lord in the 8th - The native will be longlived. If the said planet be \\n\\nweak being in the 8th the native\\'s longevity will be medium, he will be a thief, be \\n\\nblameworthy and will blame others as well.\\n\\n(6) 8th lord in the 12th - The native will spend on evil deeds and will have a \\n\\nshort life. More so, if there be additionally a malefic in the said house.\\n\\n(7) 12th lord in the 6th - The native will incur enmity with his own men, be \\n\\ngiven to anger, be sinful and, miserable.\\n\\n(8) 12th lord in 8th - The native will always gain, will speak affably, will \\n\\nenjoy a medium span of life and be endowed with qualities.\\n\\n(9) 12th lord in the 12th - The native will face heavy expenditure, and will \\n\\nnot have physical felicity, be irritable and spiteful. It will be seen from the above \\n\\nthat according to Parasara the lords of the 6th, 8th and 12th are not good enough \\n\\neven when they occupy their own houses. According to him only the 12th lord in \\n\\nthe 8th produces some good effects.\\n\\nDr. B.V. Raman also has not been kindly to the Harsha, Sarala and Vimala \\n\\nyogas   laid   down   by   Shri   Mantreswara.   In   his   book  Three   Hundred   Important \\n\\nCombinations while commenting on these three yogas he says boldly, \"These three \\n\\nyogas furnish us with a clue as to how lords of Dusthanas by occupying another \\n\\nDusthana can overcome the evil due to such malefic ownership. Even though the \\n\\nauthor   of   the   above   yogas   has   ascended   very   pleasant   results   to   these   three \\n\\ncombinations yet in actual practice, quite contrary have been the results. Parashara \\n\\nand Lomasa do not seem to favour the conception that the sting arising from an \\n\\nevil   lordship   can   disappear   entirely   as   a   result   of   the   lord   occupying   another \\n\\nDusthana. On the other hand, the intensity will be somewhat modified. This is \\n\\n81\\n\\n\\x0cevident from the fact that according to Parashara, when the 6th lord is in the 6th, \\n\\nthe native\\'s relatives become enemies while he would be friend of the outsiders; \\n\\nand when the 6th lord is in 8th or 12th, the person becomes sick, hates learned \\n\\nmen,, goes after others\\' women and takes pleasure in causing violence. Therefore, \\n\\nin interpreting the three yogas given above, one should have an eye on the intrinsic \\n\\nevil nature of the ownership\"\\n\\nIt is also stated in verse 57 of Phala Deepika that Harsha, Sarala and Vimala \\n\\nYogas will also be formed if the 6th, 8th or 12th houses be associated with or \\n\\naspected by malefics. In the context of the general principles of Hindu Astrology, \\n\\nwe find it difficult to believe that such dispositions or combinations can yield any \\n\\nauspicious effects.\\n\\nWe have not found mention of any such yogas In Brihat Jataka, Saravali and \\n\\nJataka Parijata.\\n\\n70. If the lords of the 6th, 8th and 12th houses vested with strength are \\n\\nposited in Kendra or Trikona and the lords of 1st, 10th, 4th and 9th houses be weak \\n\\nor combust, and occupy the 6th, 8th and 12th houses, the yoga so arising is named \\n\\nDuryoga. If, however, the above dispositions are in the reverse order, viz., the lords \\n\\nof the 6th, 8th and 12th houses being weak or combust occupy those houses and \\n\\nthe lords of the 1st, 4th, 9th and 10th being strong are posited in the kendra or \\n\\ntrikona   house,   the   native   will   become   a   king,   fortunate,   wealthy,   happy   and \\n\\nvirtuous.\\n\\nThus   ends   the   sixth   chapter   on   \"Yogas\"   in   Phaladeepika   composed   by  \\n\\nMantreswara.\\n\\n82\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 7\\n\\nRAJA YOGAS\\n\\n1. The native becomes a widely renowned king if at birth he has three or \\n\\nmore planets in their signs of exaltation or in their own signs posited in a kendra. \\n\\nEven one born in an ordinary family becomes a ruler of the earth possessing bands \\n\\nof elephants and horses, if five or more planets be posited in a kendra in their signs \\n\\nof exaltation or in their own sign*.\\n\\n2. A person born in a royal family becomes a king if he is not born under any \\n\\nDuryoga nor any planets at the time of his birth are eclipsed by the Sun\\'s rays. A \\n\\nperson born  in  a royal  family  becomes  a king  if  in  his nativity  three  or  more \\n\\nplanets posited in a kendra are in their signs of exaltation or in their own signs but \\n\\nif such a yoga exists in the nativity of a person born in an ordinary family, he \\n\\nbecomes influended and prosperous like a king. He can also become a king.\\n\\n3. Even a single planet, even if he be in debilitation, is capable of making a \\n\\nperson  equal  to   a king,   if  not  being   posited  in  Dusthana  (6th.   8th  or  12th)  or \\n\\ncombust and be possessed of brilliant rays and be in retrograte motion. If three or \\n\\nmore planets be so disposed, the native becomes a king. If there are many planets \\n\\nposited   in   auspicious   houses   and   Navamsas.   the   native   will   become   a   king \\n\\nendowed   with   the   inslgnias   of   royalty   such   as   crown,   umbrella   and   waving \\n\\nchowries.\\n\\n4. The native belonging to royal family becomes victorious every where if at \\n\\nhis birth two or more planets are endowed with Digbala.\\n\\nNotes — The Sun and Mars have full Dlgbala in the Bhava madhya of the \\n\\n10th house. The Moon and Venus have full Digbala in the Bhava Madhya of the \\n\\n4th house. Mercury and Jupiter have full Digbala in the Bhava madhya of the first \\n\\nhouse. Saturn has full Dlgbala in the Bhava madhya of the first house. Saturn has \\n\\nlull Digbala in the Bhava madhya of the 7th house.\\n\\nShould there be five such planets (excepting Saturn) or at least 4 planets \\n\\npossessing Digbala, even the person born in an ordinary family, becomes a king.\\n\\n83\\n\\n\\x0c5. When the Lagna and the Moon both be In Vargottama Navamsas and \\n\\nwhen   the   Lagna   be   aspected   by   four   planets   other   than   the   Moon,   the   person \\n\\nbelonging even to a low family becomes a king.\\n\\n6. Should at birth the lord of the Langa being Vargottama be posited in a \\n\\nkendra or Trikona and the lord being Vargottama be posited in a kendra or the 9th \\n\\nin his own sign or his sign of exaltation, the native will become a king who will \\n\\noccupy   a   beatiful   golden   vehicle   on   the   back   of   an   elephant,   with   chowries \\n\\nadorning the two sides.\\n\\n7. When at birth the Moon is brilliant with white luster and is aspected by \\n\\nplanet disposed in his own sign or his sign of exaltation, even the person whose \\n\\nlegitimacy is questionable, will become a king.\\n\\nWhen the full Moon is placed in Kendra other than the Lagna the native will \\n\\nbecome a king owning elephants and horses.\\n\\n8.  When   at   birth   Venus   being   placed   in  Aswini   Nakshatra   occupies   the \\n\\nLagna and is aspected by three planets, the person concerned becomes a powerful \\n\\nking capable of overcoming his enemies.\\n\\nWhen the lord of Lagna is powerful and occupies the 2nd house with Venus \\n\\nin   a  sign  which  is   not   his  sign   of  depression  nor   an  enemy\\'s  sign,  the  person \\n\\nconcerned will become a king.\\n\\n9. Should Mars be in Aries or Sagittarius identical with the lagna and be \\n\\naspected by a friendly planet, the person concerned becomes a king.\\n\\nShould the lord of the 9th be in the 10th and vice versa, the person born \\n\\nbecomes a king who is extolled by all (This is a very powerful Raja Yoga).\\n\\n10. Should the Sun in conjunction with the Moon be posited in the middle of \\n\\nSagittarius, Saturn be occupying the Lagna and a very powerful Mars be in his sign \\n\\nof exaltation, the native will become an extremely valourous king who will be \\n\\noffered solutations out of fear by his enemies from a distance.\\n\\nNotes - It will be relevant to quote here Varahamihir who in his great work \\n\\nBrihat Jataka has specified that Saturn is capable of conferring royalty if were to \\n\\nrise with the ascendant identical with Libra, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius or \\n\\n84\\n\\n\\x0cPisces.\\n\\n11. If the Moon brilliant with disc resembling nectar and lotus stalk in color \\n\\n(i.e.   the   full   Moon)   occupies   a   Navamsa   owned   by   the   Sun   and   benefics \\n\\nunassociated with malefics occupy kendra, the person born will become a king \\n\\nowning many elephants.\\n\\n12. Should the Moon be brilliant and as white as milk or conch (i.e. full) and \\n\\nthree   other   planets   not   being   in   depression   sign   or   vargas   or   inimical   sign   or \\n\\ninimical vargas, be in their own Navamsas and be receiving the aspect of benefics, \\n\\nthe person born becomes lord of the Earth (king) and Vanquishes his enemies.\\n\\n13. Should the Moon having attained Vargottamsa be aspected by a strong \\n\\nplanet and no malefic be posited in the Lagna the person will become an emperor \\n\\nand possess a well formed body.\\n\\n14. When Jupiter, Mercury and Venus or the Moon are posited in 9th with \\n\\nbrilliant   rays   uneclipsed   and   are   also   aspected   by   or   associated   with   friendly \\n\\nplanets, the person born will become a great king and will be worshipped by his \\n\\nsubjects like a deity.\\n\\n15. Should Jupiter and Venus be in Meena, Saturn be exalted, the full Moon \\n\\nbe aspected by Mars and the Sun be in Aries identical with the Lagna, the native \\n\\nconcerned will become a king owning a vast army by whose marching so much \\n\\ndust is raised that Sun becomes invisible and as a consequence the lotus flowers \\n\\nbegin to contract under the impression that the Sun has set.\\n\\nNotes — This verse appears to be somewhat confusing and complicated and \\n\\nhas led to commentators to interpret it in more than one way. The translation given \\n\\nabove is that based on the interpretation by Shri V. Subrahmanya Shastri.\\n\\nAccording to him this is the  only  possible combination  the  author  could \\n\\nhave had in view as otherwise a full Moon in exaltation with the Sun in Aries is an \\n\\nimpossibility, the Moon to be in exaltation, she should be placed in Taurus. If the \\n\\nSun   were   to   be   in  Aries   the   Moon   cannot   be   full.   In   further   explaining   the \\n\\ncombination Shri Shastri has said that planetary position as per his translation will \\n\\nbe as follows:\\n\\n85\\n\\n\\x0cVenus and Jupiter are in Pisces. Aries is rising with the Sun in it, the Moon \\n\\nis in Libra and Saturn is exalted there. Mars placed in Cancer aspects the Moon \\n\\n(This is in view of the phrase Teevravilochana Mars Is strong in his 4th glance). \\n\\nThe reader should see for himself that in the above combination, Venus, the Sun \\n\\nand Saturn are exalted Jupiter is In his own sign. The Sun, Mars and Saturn are in \\n\\nKendra.   Saturn   has   got   full   Digbala.   Mars   thougn   devoid   of   Digbala   has   got \\n\\nNeechabhanga Raja Yoga, as per verses 27 to 30 of this Chapter with the above \\n\\ncombination, the  lord  of Ascendant  with Neechabhanga Raja Yoga through  the \\n\\nMoon definitely confers kingship on the native.\\n\\nJup\\nVen\\n\\nSun\\nL\\n\\nMars\\n\\nMoon \\nSat\\n\\nHowever,   according   to   the   interpretation   of   the   well   known   author   and \\n\\ncommentator Pt. Gopesh Kumar Qjha, the disposition of planets should be as under \\n\\n:— Venus, Jupiter and Saturn are in Pisces. The Moon is full and is placed in \\n\\nTaurus in her sign of exaltation. The Sun is aspected by Mars and the Lagna is \\n\\nidentical with Aries.\\n\\nThe Sun has to be in Scorpio for the Moon to be full and Mars has been in \\n\\nTaurus or Leo to be able to aspect the Sun. We feel that Shri Ojha\\'s interpretation is \\n\\nnot correct as the combination formed according to it is not strong enough to form \\n\\na Raja Yoga and confer kingship on the native.\\n\\n86\\n\\n\\x0cJup\\nVen\\nSat\\n\\nL\\n\\nMars \\nMoon\\n\\nMars\\n\\nSun\\n\\n16. (a) The birth be at night (b) the Moon be in Cancer identical with 10th \\n\\nhouse, (c) benefics being in depression or inimical signs be posited in the 3, 6, 11 \\n\\nhouses or be in deep exaltation or be all posited in kendras uneclipsed. When the \\n\\nnative has such a disposition of planets at birth, he becomes, a great king ruling the \\n\\nthree worlds under one umbrella.\\n\\n17.   If   the   full   Moon   be   in   Vargottamamsa,   the   person   born   becomes   a \\n\\npowerful King of the Earth and is highly renowned. He will possess an army with \\n\\nhorses, the dust raised by whose hoofs overshadows the light of the Sun and it \\n\\nresembles that of the Moon in the morning.\\n\\n18. Should Jupiter and the Moon be in kendra aspected by Venus with no \\n\\nplanet in his sign of debilitation, the person born becomes king with unequalled \\n\\nfame.\\n\\n19. If at birth the Moon be in a watery sign and Navamsa identical with \\n\\nLagna and also be in his own or benefic Varga, with no malefics in Kendra. the \\n\\nnative becomes a King owning many elephants.\\n\\n20. Five Yogas are described in this Verse which are as follows —\\n\\n(a) If Venus is aspected by Jupiter a person born in a royal family becomes a \\n\\n87\\n\\n\\x0cKing.\\n\\n(b) If Jupiter occupies a sign other than Capricorn identical with Lagna, the \\n\\nnative becomes a King with many elephants under his charge.\\n\\n(c) A King will be born if in a nativity the lord of the Lagna vested with full \\n\\nstrength occupies a Kendra.\\n\\n(4) If at birth Mercury with full strength is posited in Kendra and is aspected \\n\\nby Jupiter, the native becomes so influential that the Kings act according to his \\n\\nadvice.\\n\\n21. Two Yogas are described in this Verse as described below —\\n\\n(1) Even one planet posited in his sign of exaltation aspected by a friendly \\n\\nplanet enables the native to become a king. If such a planet be also associated with \\n\\na friendly planet, the native will become extremely rich and prosperous.\\n\\n(2) If the Sun be in his own Navamsa and the Moon be in his own sign, the \\n\\nnative becomes a King possessing many horses and elephants.\\n\\nNote — In the Yoga mentioned at (2) above, it should be necessary for the \\n\\nRasi of the Sun and the Navamsa of the Moon to be strong. The strength of a \\n\\nhoroscope depends to a great extent on the strength of the Sun and the Moon.\\n\\n22. There are again two Raja Yogas in this verse as described below: —\\n\\n(1)   Should   the   Moon   with   full   rays   be   in   Pisces   aspected   by   a   friendly \\n\\nplanet, the native will become a king with pre-eminent position and delighting the \\n\\nworld.\\n\\n(2) Should the Moon be full and be in his sign of exaltation the native will \\n\\nbecome a very generous, charitable and praiseworthy King.\\n\\n23. Should the Moon be in the Navamasa of an Adhimitra aspected fully by \\n\\nVenus. The native will become a very wealthy King.\\n\\nShould the Moon in the above position be aspected by Jupiter, the person \\n\\nborn will become a King reigning over the entire Earth.\\n\\n24. The following are 4 Raja yogas declared by those versed in the science \\n\\nof Astrology —\\n\\n(1) Malefics posited in the 3rd, 6th and 11th house counted from\\n\\n88\\n\\n\\x0cThe house occupied by the lord of Lagna, Moon or from the Lagna.\\n\\n(2) Mars and Mercury occupying the 2nd house from the Lagna.\\n\\n(3) The Sun and Venus located together in the 4th house.\\n\\n(4) Mars, Saturn and Jupiter be housed respectively in the 10th, 11th and the \\n\\nLagna.\\n\\n25. Should one out of the lords of the 11th, the 9th and the 2nd houses \\n\\noccupies a Kendra with reference to the Moon and should Jupiter own the 2nd, the \\n\\n5th or the 11th house, the Yoga so formed enables the person born to become the \\n\\nlord of a full fledged empire.\\n\\n26. A planet in debilitation is considered adverse in effect. But there arise \\n\\ncircumstances when the debilitation of such a planet is cancelled giving rise to \\n\\nNeechabhang Raja Yoga. These circumstances are explained below.\\n\\nI at birth a planet is posited in sign of debilitation and the lord of the sign of \\n\\ndebilitation be in Kendra from the Moon or Lagna or the planet that is exalted in \\n\\nthe sign be in Kendra to the Moon or the Lagna, the debilitation of the Planet \\n\\nconcerned gets cancelled and a Raja Yoga is formed enabling the native to become \\n\\na very powerful King.\\n\\nNote — There is some difference of opinion about the interpretation of the \\n\\nword   Uchchanatha.   Suppose   Saturn   is   in   the  Aries   in   debilitation   who   will   be \\n\\nUchchanatha   of   Saturn?   According   to   one   view   Saturn   is   exalted   in   Libra. \\n\\nTherefore lord of Libra, namely, Venus is the Uchchanatha. Another view is that \\n\\nSaturn being in Aries and the Sun is exalted in Aries. Therefore the Sun is the \\n\\nUchchanatha.   In   our   view   the   second   view   is   more   appropriate.  There   is   also \\n\\ndifference of opinion whether the conditions mentioned above have to be fulfilled \\n\\nbefore debilitation gets cancelled. Shri V. Subrahmanaya Shastri has taken the view \\n\\nthat   any   of   the   two   conditions   should   be   enough   for   the   cancellation   of   the \\n\\ndebilitation. Pt. Gopesh Kumar Ojha has taken the view that both the conditions \\n\\nhave to be fulfilled. We are of the view that it should be enough for any of the two \\n\\nconditions to be fulfilled for the cancellation of the debilitation. Our view and that \\n\\nof Shri Shastri is supported by Jataka Parijata.\\n\\n89\\n\\n\\x0cJup\\n\\nSat\\nKetu\\n\\nMars\\n\\nL\\nMoon\\n\\nVen\\n\\nSun \\nMerc\\n\\nKetu\\n\\nSaturn is in his sign of debilitation. His debilitation gets cancelled as Mars \\n\\nthe lord of the sign in which Saturn is posted, in Kendra to the Lagna and the \\n\\nMoon. Sun who is exalted in Aries is also in Kendra to the Lagna.\\n\\nIllustration\\n\\n27. Should at birth a planet be posited in his sign of debilitation, and the lord \\n\\nof that depression sign and the lord of the planet\\'s exaltation sign are in Kendra \\n\\npositions mutually, the debilitation gets cancelled The Neechabhanga Raja Yoga so \\n\\nformed produces a powerful King of Kings.\\n\\n28. If a planet is in his sign of debilitation, and is aspected by the lord of that \\n\\nsign, the debilitation gets cancelled and by the Neechabhanga Raja Yoga so formed \\n\\nthe native becomes a ruler of the Earth and famous. And if in the above Yoga if the \\n\\nplanet be placed in an auspicious case still better effects may be expected.\\n\\n29. When the planet is posited in his sign of debilitation, if the lord of the \\n\\nsign so occupied or the lord of the planet\\'s exaltation sign be in a Kendra position \\n\\nwith reference to the Lagna or the Moon, the person so born will become very \\n\\nwealthy   emperor.   He   will   perform  virtuous   actions   and   will   be   very   powerful, \\n\\nfamous and affluent.\\n\\n30.   If   a   planet   in   his   sign   of   debilitation   be   in   a   Kendra   position   with \\n\\n90\\n\\n\\x0creference   to   the   Moon   or   the   Lagna,   the   debilitation   gets   cancelled   and   the \\n\\nNeechabhanga Raja Yoga so formed will produce an emperor revered by other \\n\\nKings.\\n\\nNates   —   Thus   there   are   five   kinds   of   Neechabhanga   Raja   Yogas   as \\n\\ndescribed below:—\\n\\n(1) The lord of the depression sign or the planet that is exalted in that sign, is \\n\\nin a Kendra position from the Lagna or the Moon.\\n\\n(2) The lord of the sign of debilitation and the lord of the exaltation sign of \\n\\nthe debilitation planet are mutually in Kendra positions.\\n\\n(3) The planet in the sign of debilitation is aspected by the lord of that sign.\\n\\n(4) The lord of the sign of debilitation or the lord of the exaltation sign of the \\n\\nplanet in debilitation, is in Kendra from the Lagna or the Moon.\\n\\n(5) The planet in his sign of debilitation is in Kendra with reference to the \\n\\nLagna or the Moon.\\n\\nThus   ends   the   seventh   chapter   on   \"Maharaja   Yogas\"   in   Phaladeepika  \\n\\ncomposed by Mantreswara.\\n\\n91\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 8\\n\\nEffects of planets in different houses\\n\\nThe Sun\\n\\n1-4. If the Sun be In the 1st house at birth, the native will have scanty hair. \\n\\nHe will be lazy, of hot disposition, impetuous and tall In stature. He will have \\n\\nsoiled eyes and a lean and thin body. He will be cruel, impatient and valourous. \\n\\nThe Sun in the 1st house with Cancer as the Lagna will give the native cataract in \\n\\nthe eyes with the Lagna as Aries, the Sun in the 1st house will cause eye disease. In \\n\\nLeo Lagna the Sun will cause night blindness. If the Lagna be Libra and the Sun \\n\\noccupies it, the native will be devoid of wealth and suffer from loss of children.\\n\\nWhen the Sun is in the 2nd house at birth, the person concerned will be \\n\\nwithout any learning; he will be shameless and will be stammering.\\n\\nShould the Sun occupy the 3rd house, the native will be powerful, valiant, \\n\\nwealthy and generous. He will have inimical relations with his kinsmen.\\n\\nIf   the   Sun   be   in   4th   house,   the   native   will   be   bereft   of   happiness   and \\n\\ncomfort, relations, lands, friends and house. He will be in Government service and \\n\\nwill squander away his ancestral property.\\n\\nWhen the Sun is in the 5th house from the Lagna, the person concerned will \\n\\nbe short tempered and will be deprived of happiness, wealth and children. He will \\n\\nbe intelligent and wander in forest regions.\\n\\nIf the Sun be in the 6th house, the native will become a king. He will earn \\n\\nrenown and will be equipped with praiseworthy qualities. He will be wealthy and \\n\\ncapable of overcoming his enemies.\\n\\nWhen the Sun is in the 7th at birth, the person concerned will suffer from the \\n\\nwrath of the king. He will have deformed body and will have no wife. He will \\n\\nsuffer humiliation from others.\\n\\nWith the Sun in the 8th house, the person born will be deprived of his wealth \\n\\nand friends. He will be short-lived and suffer from defective eyesight. He can be \\n\\nblind also.\\n\\n92\\n\\n\\x0cNotes   —   From   the   8th   house   the   Sun   will   aspect   the   2nd   house   which \\n\\nrepresents the right eye. Thus the Sun\\'s placement in 8th house should certainly \\n\\naffect the right eye. The Sun represents light and when he is placed in the 8th the \\n\\nworst dusthana, he can deprive the native of his eyesight.\\n\\nShould the Sun be In 9th house at birth, the person concerned is likely to \\n\\nsuffer  from the  loss of  his father, but  he will  not  be deprived  of  children  and \\n\\nrelations. He will have due respect foi gods and Brahmins.\\n\\nWith the Sun in the 10th house, the native will be blessed with sons and will \\n\\nenjoy the comfort of conveyances. He will receive praise for his good conduct and \\n\\nwill have Intelligence, wealth, strength and fame. He will be a king.\\n\\nNotes — Sun has Digbala in the 10th. For the above very good effects, the \\n\\nLagna   should   be  Aries,   Taurus,   Cancer,   Leo,   Libra,   Scorpio,   Sagittarius   and \\n\\nAquarius. In other Lagnas the Sun Will not own any auspicious house and will not \\n\\nbe capable of producing the good effects described above.\\n\\nThe Sun in the 11th house makes the native very wealthy and long lived. He \\n\\nwill be a king with ever lasting happiness.\\n\\nShould the Sun be in the 12th house at birth the native will have inimical \\n\\nrelations with his father. His eyesight will be defective and he will be devoid of \\n\\nwealth and children.\\n\\nThe MOON\\n\\n5-7. If at birth the Moon be waxing and be posited in the first house (the \\n\\nlagna), the native will possess a strong constitution and will be longlived.

Such a person becomes Minister of a king.\\n\\nIf the Moon be in the sixth house the person born will be short lived, will be \\n\\nstupid and sufferer of stomach ailments. He will aslo face humiliation.\\n\\nShould the Moon be housed in the 7th at birth, the person concerned will be \\n\\nbeautiful in his looks, and will be loved by a faithful and illustrious wife.\\n\\nWhen the Moon occupies the 8th house at birth, the person concerned will \\n\\nbe sickly and shortlived.\\n\\nShould the Moon happen to be in the 9th house, the person born will be \\n\\nwealthy, virtuous and will be blessed with children.\\n\\nThe   Moon   in   10th   house   at   birth   makes   the   native   victorious   over   his \\n\\nenemies, and achieve success in all his ventures. He will be engaged in pious deeds \\n\\nand will be a supporter of good people.\\n\\nShould the Moon occupy the 11th house at birth, the person concerned will \\n\\nbe high minded, longlived and wealthy and will be blessed with children. He will \\n\\nalso have comforts of servants.\\n\\nWhen   the   Moon   is   placed   in   the   12th   house,   the   native   is   indolent, \\n\\nhumiliated and unhappy. Others have animosity against him.\\n\\nMARS\\n\\n8-10. If Mars occupies the 1st house or the Lagna, the native will be very \\n\\ncruel but valourous. He will be short lived and his body will get bruised.\\n\\nWhen Mars is posited in the 2nd house at birth, the native will not be good \\n\\nlooking and will not be clever in speaking. He will have tearing and will be devoid \\n\\nof wealth. He will be serving low people.\\n\\nShould   Mars  be  in  the  3rd  house   at   birth,  the  person   concerned   will   be \\n\\nequipped with qualities, will be powerful, happy and brave. He will be not subdued \\n\\nby others. But he will be deprived of the happiness of brothers.\\n\\n94\\n\\n\\x0cWhen Mars is placed in the 4th house, the native will be bereft of mother, \\n\\nfriends, happiness, conveyances and lands.\\n\\nThe person concerned will have no children and will face many disasters, \\n\\nshould the Mars happen to occupy the 5th house at birth. The native will be a \\n\\ntalebearer and without enough intelligence.\\n\\nShould Mars happen to occupy the 6th house at birth, the person concerned \\n\\nwill   be   wealthy,   generous,   capable   of   vanquishing   his   enemies   and   will   have \\n\\nsplendour like that of a king. Mars in the 6th makes the native very sensuous.\\n\\nWhen Mars is in the 7th, the person born will indulge in undesirable actions, \\n\\nwill be afflicted by diseases and will have a wife who will die prematurely.\\n\\nNote — Mars in the 7th produces very strong Manglik Dosha. If the native \\n\\nis a man he loses his wife. If the native is a woman she becomes a widow. It is, \\n\\nhowever, widely believed that if both the husband and wife are Manglik, the Dosha \\n\\ngets cancelled. There is Manglik Dosha when Mars occupies the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 7th, \\n\\n8th and 12th houses.\\n\\nMars   in  the   8th  house  gives   the   native   a  diseased   body,  deprive  him  of \\n\\nwealth and makes him shortlived and reviled by others. Should Mars occupy the \\n\\n9th house, the native will face animosity from others even if he be a favourite of \\n\\nthe king.

Should Mercury be posited in the 1st house or the lagna, the native \\n\\nwill be learned in all Shastras, will be soft spoken and longlived.\\n\\n95\\n\\n\\x0cIf Mercury happens to occupy the 2nd house at birth the person earns his \\n\\nlivelihood by his intelligence. He will compose poems and will be cultured in his \\n\\nspeech. He will get sweetish preparations to eat.\\n\\nIf Mercury be in the 3rd house, the person born will be brave but will have a \\n\\nmedium span of life.

He will be blessed with \\n\\nthe grace of God.\\n\\nNotes — It is said that if Jupiter is in Lagna, the native is blessed with the \\n\\ngrace of God because from there he aspects the 5th, 7th and 9th house i.e. houses \\n\\nof children, wife and bhagya.

He can never be as beneficial as Jupiter \\n\\nin the Lagna because he possesses one lull aspect only and that will fall on the 7th \\n\\nhouse only.\\n\\nShould Venus occupy the 2nd house at birth, the native will be a poet and \\n\\nwill enjoy riches of various kinds.\\n\\nIf Venus be In the 3rd house at birth, the native will be miserly, unpopular, \\n\\ndevoid of wealth, happiness and wife.\\n\\nWith Venus occupying the 4th house, the person born, the native will be \\n\\nendowed with good conveyances, a decent house, ornaments, clothes and scents.\\n\\nWhen Venus be in the 5th house at birth, the native will be endowed with \\n\\nwealth and will be as influential and renowned as a king.

He will develop ilicit relations  with \\n\\nseveral young girls, but will not enjoy happiness.\\n\\nShould  Venus   be   placed   in   7th   house   at   birth,   the   native   will   enjoy   the \\n\\ncompany of a faithful and beautiful wife and he may lose his wife. He will be \\n\\nwealthy and will have intrigues with bad women.\\n\\nVenus   posited   in   the   8th   house   at   birth,   will   make   the   native   wealthy, \\n\\nlonglived and a landlord.\\n\\nIf Venus occupies the 9th house at birth, the native will draw his fortune \\n\\nthrough   the   beneficience   of   the   king.

He will be rich and prosperous.\\n\\nSATURN\\n\\n20-24. If at birth Saturn is in the Lagna in his sign of exaltation (Libra) or in \\n\\nhis own sign (Capricorn and Aquarius), the person concerned will be equal to the \\n\\nking, a chief or mayor of a city. If Saturn be in the Lagna in any other sign, the \\n\\nnative will suffer from sorrow and misery from his very childhood and will be \\n\\npoverty stricken. He will be living shabbily and will be inactive.\\n\\nNotes   —  According   to   Brihat   Jataka   if   Saturn   occupied   the   Lagna   at   a \\n\\nperson\\'s birth, he will be poor, sickly, love-stricken, very unclean, Suffering from \\n\\ndiseases during his childhood. However, if any of the signs Sagittarius, Pisces, \\n\\nAquarius, Capricorn and Libra be the Lagna and Saturn should occupy it at birth, \\n\\nthe person concerned will be equal to king, the headman of a village or the mayor \\n\\nof a city, a great scholar and will be handsome. Uttarakalamrit and Mansagari have \\n\\nsupported this view.\\n\\nShould Saturn be in the 2nd house at birth, the face of the native will be \\n\\nunattractive. He will not take the righteous path and will be devoid of wealth but in \\n\\nthe latter part of his life he will quit his native place and will then possess wealth, \\n\\nconveyance and all enjoyments of life.\\n\\nIf Saturn should happen to occupy the 3rd house at birth, the native will be \\n\\nvery intelligent, wise and liberal and will live with his wife. However, he will be \\n\\nindolent and unhappy.\\n\\nIf Saturn be in the 4th house at birth, the native will be bereft of house, \\n\\nrespect and mother. He will be sickly in his childhood. He will also be unhappy.\\n\\n99\\n\\n\\x0cIf Saturn occupied the 5th house the person concerned will be evil minded \\n\\nand wicked.  He  will  be  bereft  of  learning,  children,   wealth  and  happiness.  He \\n\\nroams about aimlessly.\\n\\nShould Saturn occupy the 6th house at birth, the person concerned will be \\n\\nglutton, wealthy and will vanquish his enemies. He will also be arrogant.\\n\\nWhen   at   birth   Saturn   is   posited   in   the   7th   house,   the   native   develops \\n\\nrelations  with  women of questionable  character. He will  be poverty  stricken, a \\n\\nwanderer and unhappy.\\n\\nSaturn   occupying   the   8th   house   at   birth   will   make   the   native   unclean \\n\\nafflicted  with   piles,  devoid  of  wealth,  of  cruel   disposition,  hungry  and  will  be \\n\\navoided by his friends.\\n\\nShould   Saturn   occupy   the   9th   house,   the   native   will   be   devoid   of   good \\n\\nfortune, wealth, children father and will be irreligious. He will also be wicked.\\n\\nNotes   —  A View   has   been   taken   that   as   the   9th   house   is   the   house   of \\n\\nDharma, Saturn occupying it will bring about a revolution in this sphere. If there \\n\\nbe a Saturn endowed with strength in the 9th house and be aspected byjupiter, the \\n\\nperson   will   follow   Dharmic   principles   strictly   and   will   be   a   tapasvi.   In   Ma \\n\\nAnanamayee\\'s birth Saturn is exalted in the 9th (Aquarius Ascendent). In Swami \\n\\nKarpatri\\'s birth chart Saturn is in the 9th and the Sun, Jupiter, Venus and Mercury \\n\\nare in the lagna idnentical with Cancer.\\n\\nThis is horoscope of Swami Ramakrishna Paramahamsa. Saturn is exalted in \\n\\n9th.\\n\\nSaturn in 10th house enables the native to be king or equal to the king. He \\n\\nwill be valiant, renowned and will be engaged in agricultural pursuits.\\n\\n100\\n\\n\\x0cKetu\\n\\nJup\\n\\nVen\\n\\nL\\nSun \\nMoon\\n\\nMars\\n\\nRahu\\n\\nSat\\n\\nSaturn in the 11th makes the native devoid of ill health and enables him \\n\\nlasting income and wealth.\\n\\nShould Saturn occupy the 12th house at birth, the native will be impudent, \\n\\npoor, childless, defective of some limb, stupid and defeated by his enemies.\\n\\nRAHU\\n\\n25-27. When Rahu is in the occupaton of the 1st house at birth, the native \\n\\nwill be shortlived, wealthy and strong and suffer from diseases in the higher limbs \\n\\n(Face, head etc.).\\n\\nThe person who has Rahu in the 2nd house at birth, will be insincere in \\n\\nspeech and his words will carry double meaning.

He   will   be   wealthy   and \\n\\nlonglived and will suffer from ulcer in the anus.\\n\\nRahu in the 7th house at birth makes the person concerned independent, but \\n\\nwithout intelligence. He squanders away his money by associating with women. \\n\\nHe will become a widower and also impotent.\\n\\nIf Rahu be posited in the 8th house the native will become miserable, will \\n\\nsuffer from rheumatism, will have few children and will indulge in impure actions.\\n\\nIf Rahu occupies the 9th house at birth, the native will be harsh in speech \\n\\nand will indulge in unrighteous actions but he will become head of a clan, city or a \\n\\nvillage.\\n\\nIf Rahu be in the 10th house, the person born will have a limited number of \\n\\nissues, engaged in working for others, will not perform any rightful deeds, will be \\n\\nfearless and famous.\\n\\nWith Rahu occupying the 11th house at birth, the native will be wealthy and \\n\\nlonglived, will have a limited number of issues, and will suffer from some disease \\n\\nof the ear.\\n\\nRahu in the 12th house at birth makes a man squanderer of money, will \\n\\nindulge in sinful deeds and suffer from diseases like dropsy etc.\\n\\nKETU\\n\\n28-33. When Ketu occupies the 1st house or the Lagna, the person born will \\n\\nbe ungrateful, unhappy and tale bearer, will associate with unsociable elements, \\n\\ndeformed in his body, fallen from position and outcaste.\\n\\nWith Ketu in the 2nd house at birth, the native will be bereft of learning and \\n\\nwill   have   a   harsh   manner   of   speaking.   He   will   have   a   sinister   look   and   be \\n\\ndependent for food on others.\\n\\nShould Ketu occupy the 3rd house at birth, the native will be longlived, \\n\\npowerful and renowned. He will live happily with his wife and will eat good food; \\n\\nbut he will be deprived of a brother.\\n\\nWith Ketu occupying the 4th house at birth, the native will live in another \\n\\nman\\'s house and will lose his lands, mother and happiness. He will be forced to \\n\\n102\\n\\n\\x0cleave his native land.\\n\\nKetu in the 5th house at a person\\'s birth deprives the native of his children. \\n\\nHe will be evil minded and will be oppressed by goblins (evil spirits).\\n\\nIf Ketu occupies the 6th house at birth, the native will be magnanimous, full \\n\\nof best qualities, firm, renowned and will be vested with high authority. He will \\n\\nvanquish his enemies and will be successful in obtaining Ishta Siddhi.\\n\\nKetu\\'s   occupation   of   the   7th   house   at   birth   will   make   the   native   suffer \\n\\nhumiliation. He will associate with fallen women and will be separated from his \\n\\nown wife. He will suffer from diseases of the bowels and may lose his potency.\\n\\nWith   Ketu   occupying   the   8th   house   at   birth,   the   native   will   suffer   from \\n\\nseparation from his nears and dears. He will be quarrelsome and shortlived. He \\n\\nwill get injury from some weapon and will be unsuccessful in all his ventures.\\n\\nKetu   In   the   9th   house   at   birth,   makes   the   native   indulge   in   sinful   and \\n\\nunrighteous actions. He will be deprived of his father, will be unfortunate, poverty \\n\\nstricken and will defame others.\\n\\nIf Ketu occupies the 10th house at a person\\'s birth, he will face obstacles in \\n\\nperforming good acts. He will be impure and indulge in wicked actions. He will be \\n\\nvery bold and famous for his valor.\\n\\nIf   Ketu   should   occupy   the   11th   house,   the   person   born   will   accumulate \\n\\nwealth and will be equipped with good qualities. He will enjoy himself and all \\n\\nitems of luxuries and comforts will be available to him. He will achieve success in \\n\\nall his undertakings.\\n\\nWhen Ketu occupies the 12th house at birth, the native will commit sinful \\n\\nacts secretly. He will squander away all his money for undesirable purposes. He \\n\\nwill destroy his wealth and take to forbidden conduct. He will suffer from diseases \\n\\nof the eyes.\\n\\n34. The effects produced by a planet of the house, will be realized in full \\n\\nwhen he has traversed the number of degrees from the commencement of the Rashi \\n\\nequal to that traversed by the Lagna point in the Lagna Rashi.\\n\\nIt is the view of the authorities that Rahu is similar to Saturn and Ketu is \\n\\n103\\n\\n\\x0csimilar to Mars in giving effects (Shani-vat Rahu, Kuja-vat Ketu).\\n\\nNotes—For   example   (1)   if   the   Lagna   point   (Lagna   Bhava-Madhya)   is   1 \\n\\ndegree and the longitude of the Saturn posited in the 5th house is also 1 degree, \\n\\nSaturn will give the full effect of the 5th house.\\n\\n(2) If the Lagna point is 29 degrees and Saturn\\'s longitude in the 5th house is \\n\\n1 degree, Saturn will produce very little effect of the same house.\\n\\n35. This verse is Intended to further explain the principle laid down in verse \\n\\n34. Find   out   how  far away  is  the   planet   in  the   house  whose  effects  are   to  be \\n\\nassessed, from the Bhavamadhya of that house. The more it is nearer to the Bhava-\\n\\nMadhya, the lesser will be the effects produced.\\n\\nNotes   —   Described   above   are   the   general   effects   of   planets   in   different \\n\\nhouses. These effects get modified by several factors such as the houses they own, \\n\\naspects on them, conjunction of other planets with them, the signs in which they \\n\\nare posited, the position of their disposition etc.\\n\\nFor   detailed   information   in   this   respect   please   refer   to   our   English \\n\\ntranslation of \\'Bhrigu Sutras\\' published by Ranjan Publications.\\n\\nThus ends the eighth chapter on \"The Effects of the Planets in 12 Bhavas\" In \\n\\nPhaladeepika composed by Mantreswara.\\n\\n104\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 9\\n\\nEffects of different Ascendants\\n\\n1. If the Ascendant falls in Aries, the native will have round eyes. His knees \\n\\nwill be weak and he will have aggressive temperament but he will be afraid of \\n\\nwater.   He   will   be   active   and   will   always   be   moving   about.   His   limbs   will   be \\n\\nbruised. He will eat sparigly and will be passionate. He will speak falsehoods.\\n\\n2.

He will be arrogant, Powerful valiant, firm minded and obedient to his \\n\\nmother. He will be fond of roaming about in forests and hills. He will get angry on \\n\\ntrifles.\\n\\n6. The person born with Virgo as the Ascendant, will be truthful and will \\n\\nspeak kindly. His eyes will be full of bashfulness and will be immediately liked by \\n\\nothers. He will be well versed in Shastras and will take advantage of other people\\'s \\n\\nhouses and wealth. His arms and shoulders will be drooped and will possess few \\n\\nsons.\\n\\n105\\n\\n\\x0c7. If the Ascendant be Libra, the person born will rever gods, and Brahmins \\n\\nbut he will be active and will possess a lean and thin body. He will be tall in \\n\\nstature, deft in trading, patient and intent on being first. He will often have two \\n\\nnames. He will have few children and he will be fond of wandering. He will be \\n\\nbrave, merciless and impartial In his arguments.\\n\\n8. The person with Scorpio Ascendant at birth, will have rounded thighs and \\n\\nknees. His chest will be broad and eyes expansive. He will suffer from diseases \\n\\nfrom an early age. He will beseperated from his parents and preceptor. He will \\n\\nindulge In cruel actions and will be honoured by the king. His feet will bear marks \\n\\nof lotus.\\n\\n9. The person with Sagittarius Ascendant at birth — His face and neck will \\n\\nbe long and his nose and ears will be big. He will always keep himself engaged in \\n\\nsome work or the other. He will be eloquent in speech and self sacrificing. He will \\n\\nhave a short stature. He will be courageous and will overcome his enemies. He will \\n\\nbe   wealthy   and   favourite   of   the   king.   He   can   be   won   over   by   persuation   and \\n\\nkindness.\\n\\n10. When Capricorn is the Ascendant at birth, his lower limbs will be weak. \\n\\nHe will have vitality. He will accept  other people\\'s advice but will be lazy by \\n\\nnature. He will indulge in affairs with old women of the forbidden category. He \\n\\nwill be a religious hypocrite. He will be fond of wandering. He will be fortunate \\n\\nbut shameless.

He will have financial gains from selling produce of the seas. He will \\n\\novercome his enemies.\\n\\n106\\n\\n\\x0c13. After examining the native place, form, colour etc., of any particular \\n\\nsign, its effects should be judiciously assessed. Whatever have been declared the \\n\\neffects arising out of a particular Ascendant, the same should also be said to come \\n\\nto pass, if the sign happens to be occupied by the Moon.\\n\\n14. If at a birth a planet be in his sign of exaltation, the person concerned \\n\\nwill become a ruler of the Earth and will receive praises from the kings. He will \\n\\npossess valuable treasures. He will be equipped with excellent qualities and will \\n\\nshine   like   king   Vikramaditya   in   his   administrative   policies,   fame,   valour \\n\\ngenerosity, courage and dexterity.\\n\\nNotes - Our view is that with exaltation of one planet in a birth chart, the \\n\\nnative cannot shine like king Vikramaditya or become a ruler of the Earth. The \\n\\nplanet   in   exaltation   to   give   extraordinarily   good   effect   should   be   placed   in   an \\n\\nauspicious house saved from any malefic influence and supported by other helpful \\n\\nplanetary combinations and dispositions.\\n\\nIn this horoscope Sun lord of the 11th is exalted in the 7th house. He is \\n\\nassociated with Mercury and Venus and aspected by Jupiter who is posited in his \\n\\nown. The Moon the lord of the 10th is in his own house. According to verse 14, the \\n\\nnative should be more than a ruler of the Earth, but he happens an ordinary person \\n\\nbelonging to middle class. The reason for this is that the exalted Sun is placed \\n\\nbetween malefics (Mars and Rahu on one side and Saturn on the other). According \\n\\nto Parasara Sun being lord of the 11th is a papi. According to Jataka Parijata Sun \\n\\nbeing lord of 11th is Badhaka.\\n\\n107\\n\\n\\x0cMars \\nRahu\\n\\nSun \\nMerc \\nVen\\n\\nSat\\n\\nMoon\\n\\nJup\\n\\nL\\n\\nKetu\\n\\nHe is aspected by Sun lord of the 3rd and the 6th. Therefore the Sun is deprived of \\n\\nauspiciousness. Although the Moon lord of the 10th is in his own sign, she is \\n\\naspected by Saturn from the 8th house. Thus no good can be expected from the \\n\\nMoon. For these reasons the native could not become a great men equal to a king.\\n\\nKetu\\n\\nJup\\nVen\\n\\nL\\nSun \\nMerc.\\n\\nMoon\\n\\nSat\\n\\nMars \\nRahu\\n\\nThis is the horoscope of Abraham Lincoln former President of the United \\n\\nStates of America. He was a great man, very learned and a political leader with all \\n\\nthe name and fame one can achieve. He held the most powerful position of the \\n\\nHead of State of the United States of American. In his horoscope Venus lord of the \\n\\n108\\n\\n\\x0c4th and 9th (a yoga karaka) is exalted in the 2nd and is associated with Jupiter lord \\n\\nof the 2nd and the 11th in his own house (2nd). There is no malefic aspect on them. \\n\\nLord of lagna Saturn is in the 10th with evil aspect or influence on him. These \\n\\nplanetary combinations and dispositions made him such great and powerful man.\\n\\n15. Should  a planet  occupy  his own sign in  a birthchart,  the  native will \\n\\nduring   the   dasa   of   such   a   planet   acquire   power   and   strength   through   the \\n\\nbeneficience   of   a   wealthy   and   high   dignitary   and   he   will   himself   achieve   that \\n\\nstatus. He will remain in his residence, acquire a new house and lands capable of \\n\\nproducing every kind of crops. He will receive reverence from the people and may \\n\\neven get back his lost articles.\\n\\n16. When a planet happens to be in the house of a friend at birth, the person \\n\\nconcerned will achieve success through the help of his friends in all his ventures. \\n\\nHis new friends will be blessed with good sons, wealth, grains and other fortunes \\n\\nand will get full support and cooperation from the people.\\n\\n17. If a planet gets posited in an inimical sign, the person born will have an \\n\\nevil bent of mind. He will live in other people\\'s houses and will eat their food. He \\n\\nwill be without any means of livelihood and will be oppressed by enemies. Even \\n\\nhis friends will become his enemies in the dasa of such a planet.\\n\\n18.  If  a  planet  occupies  his   sign  of   debilitation   in   a  nativity,  the   person \\n\\nconcerned will, during the dasa of such a planet, be demoted from his position, will \\n\\nsuffer actions, will become indebted and will depend on support of low people. He \\n\\nwill live in insanitary auditions, will perform menial tasks, will walk long distances \\n\\non foot and will do disastrous acts.\\n\\n19. If a planet be combust (eclipsed by the Sun\\'s rays), the native will during \\n\\nhis Dasa, will die within a short period. His wife, children as well as his wealth \\n\\nwill also be destroyed. He involved in quarrels without cause or reason and suffer \\n\\nfrom the others. He will also be insulted by others.\\n\\nA planet posited in a netural sign will not produce any significant effect and \\n\\nmaintain status quo.\\n\\n20. When a planet happens to be retrograde in motion, he will produce the \\n\\n109\\n\\n\\x0csame effect as if he is posited in exaltation sign, even if he may be in his enemy\\'s \\n\\nsign or in the sign of his debilitation. A planet who is vargottama produces effects \\n\\nas if he is in his own sign.\\n\\n110\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 10\\n\\nMatters relating to the 7th House\\n\\n1. The 5th and 7th houses from the lagna or the Moon be flourished if they \\n\\nare associated with or aspected by benefics or their lords, if it is not so, they will \\n\\nnot be fruitful.\\n\\nIf there be malefics in the 12th, 4th and 8th houses or if Venus be hemmed in \\n\\nbetween two malefics or if Venus be associated or aspected by malefics the native \\n\\nwill lose his wife (his wife will die).\\n\\n2. If the lord of the 7th house occupies the 5th, the native will lose his wife \\n\\nor he will become sonless. If the lord of the 5th or the 8th be in the 7th, the wife of \\n\\nthe  native  does  not  survive.  If the  weak  Moon be in  the  5th  and the  malefics \\n\\noccupy the Ascendant, 7th and 12th houses the person concerned will be without \\n\\nwife and children. If the Sun and Rahu occupy the 7th house, the native will suffer \\n\\nloss of wealth through association with women.\\n\\n3. The native loses his wife if there are any of the following disposition of \\n\\nplanets present at brith:—\\n\\n(a) Venus in Scorpio in the 7th house.\\n\\n(b) Mercury in Taurus in the 7th house.\\n\\n(c) Jupiter in Capricorn in the 7th house.\\n\\n(d) Saturn in Pisces in the 7th house.\\n\\n(e) Mars in Pisces in the 7th house.\\n\\nHowever, if Mars and Saturn occupy the 7th house identical with Cancer the \\n\\nnative will be blessed with a wife who is beautiful and of good character.\\n\\n4. The native is deprived of his wife if the 7th house or its lord be associated \\n\\nwith or aspected by malefics, hemmed in beetween  malefics, be in his sign of \\n\\ndebilition or an inimical sign or be eclipsed by the Sun\\'s rays.\\n\\nThe native will lose his wife or will have a crippled wife, when Venus in \\n\\nconjunction with malefic occupies the 7th, 5th or 9th house.\\n\\nThe native will have illicit relations with other people\\'s wives if Venus be in \\n\\n111\\n\\n\\x0cthe Varga of Mars or Saturn or be aspected by these planets.\\n\\n5. If Mars and Saturn be in the 7th from the Venus and Moon in any nativity, \\n\\nthe person concerned will be wifeless and childless.\\n\\nIf there be a hermaphrodite planet in the 7th house, and the 11th house is \\n\\noccupied by two planets, the person concerned will have two wives.\\n\\nA person will have two wives in the event of both the lord of the 7th and \\n\\nVenus being posited in a dual sign or amsa.\\n\\nThe number of wives should be generally ascertained from the number of \\n\\nplanets that are in conjunction with the lord of 7th house and Venus.\\n\\n6. The native will associate with as many women as is the number of planets \\n\\nposited in the 7th house. The number of women, who will die, will be equal to the \\n\\nnumber   of   malefics,   and   the   number   of   benefics   will   represent   the   number   of \\n\\nwomen who will survive.\\n\\nShould the lord of the 7th house be a benefic endowed will strength, the \\n\\nnative will have a wife who will be of good character and will bear children.\\n\\nEven a malefic if he being lord of 7th be posited in the 7th will bless the \\n\\nnative with a good wife.\\n\\nBenefics in the 7th house will produce good effects unless they happen to be \\n\\nlords of the 6th, 8th or 12th house.\\n\\n7. Loss of wife will result if the 2nd and 7th houses are associated with or \\n\\naspected by malefics. The result will invariably be untoward in the case of malefic \\n\\naspects.\\n\\nSimilar results may be declared from the wife\\'s nativity if the 7th and 8th \\n\\nhouses are similarly afflicted.\\n\\nBut should the above two houses be associated with or aspected by benefics, \\n\\nthe couple will enjoy good luck and comforts.\\n\\n8. If in a female\\'s birth chart, the Moon and Saturn be together in the 7th \\n\\nhouse, the native marries again (after the first marriage).\\n\\nIf there be such a planetary disposition in man\\'s nativity, he will be wifeless \\n\\nor childless.\\n\\n112\\n\\n\\x0cIf malefics in their signs of debilitation be posited in the 2nd, 7th and 8th, in \\n\\nfemale\\'s nativity the disposition will make her a widow and in a man\\'s chart, it will \\n\\nrender him a widower.\\n\\n9. If the 7th house from the Ascendant be an even sign and the lord of the \\n\\n7th and Venus be also posited in even signs, and if the lord of the 5th and 7th \\n\\npossessed of strength be not eclisped by Sun\\'s rays, the native will be blessed with \\n\\nwife and children.\\n\\n10. The native will be happy and will be blessed with wife and children, if \\n\\nthe lords of the 2nd, 7th and 12th be posited in kendra or trikona aspected by \\n\\nJupiter   and   there   be   benefics   in   the   2nd,   7th   and   11th   to   the   lord   of   the   7th \\n\\nwherever he may be.\\n\\n11. Note the sign and navamsa in male s nativity. The signs in which the \\n\\nlords of the ascendant and 7th are posited, the Janma Rashi (Moon sign) of the \\n\\nwife will be triangular to such sign or navamsa, or it may be the exaltation or \\n\\ndepression sign of the lords of the 1st and 7th or it be that sign which contains the \\n\\nlargest number of benefic dots in the Moon\\'s Ashtakavarga of the husband.\\n\\n12. The direction of the country of the wife will be indicated by the sign \\n\\nowned by the strongest of the three planets, namely (1) the planet posited in the 7th \\n\\nhouse, (2) the lord of the 7th house and (3) Venus.\\n\\nThe marriage of the native should take place when the Venus or the lord of \\n\\nthe 7th transits through a sign which is trine to the sign or navamsa occupied by the \\n\\nlord of the ascendant.\\n\\n13. The marriage is likely to take place during the dasha of the planet (1) \\n\\noccupying the 7th house, (2) which aspects the 7th house or (3) the lord of the 7th \\n\\nhouse. It can also take place when the lord of the ascendant transits through the \\n\\nsign representing the 7th house.\\n\\n14. Find out who amongst (1) the lord of the sign in which lord of the 7th is \\n\\nposited and the lord of the navamsa which the lord of the 7th occupies and (2) \\n\\nVenus and Moon, is stronger. The marriage will take place in the dasha of this \\n\\nstronger planet when Jupiter in transit passes through the sign triangular to the sign \\n\\n113\\n\\n\\x0cor navamsa occupied by the lord of the 7th.\\n\\n15. If the lord of the 7th be posited in his sign of debilitation,  be in an \\n\\ninimical   sign,   be   combust   or   be   aspected   by   a   malefic   and   the   7th   house   be \\n\\noccupied or aspected by a malefic, there will be loss of wife. So say the men well \\n\\nversed in the science of Astrology.\\n\\nThus ends the tenth chapter on \"Kalatra Bhava\" in Phaladeepika composed  \\n\\nby Mantreswara.\\n\\n114\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 11\\n\\nFemale Horoscopy\\n\\n1. Whatever effects have been declared for men, they are entirely appicable \\n\\nto women too, or to their husbands. The woman\\'s prosperity and happiness have to \\n\\nbe   deducted   from   the   8th   house   (from   the   Lagna   or   the   Moon   whichever   is \\n\\nstronger).   Consideration   of   children   should   be   made   from   the   9th   house   and \\n\\nmatters relating to her appearance, looks etc., should be examined from the Langa. \\n\\nIt is from the 7th house that her welfare (power of influencing the husband) and the \\n\\n(nature of the husband) should be assessed, while her association with other men \\n\\nand chastity should be assessed from an examination of the 4th house. Benefics in \\n\\nthese   houses   produce   good   results   while   malefics   in   the   above   houses   are \\n\\nproductive of evil unless they happen to own the house in which the effect will be \\n\\ngood.\\n\\nNotes — This is a very important verse of this chapter. It will, therefore, be \\n\\nuseful for the readers to know what other authorities have said in this regard.\\n\\nSaravali\\n\\nFrom the 8th house her widowhood can be deducted while the ascendant \\n\\ndeals with her physique, the 7th house with her husband\\'s good fortunes and the \\n\\n5th house with her offspring.\\n\\nBrihat Jataka\\n\\nOf   the   effects   that   have   been   described   till   now   in   the   case   of   male \\n\\nhoroscopes, all those that may be found in (female horoscope) suitable to females \\n\\nshould be declared as applicable to them alone; the rest should be ascribed to their \\n\\nhusbands. Hie death of the husband is to be declared through the 8th place (from \\n\\nthe Langa or the Moon whichever is stronger). Matters relating to her appearance, \\n\\nbeauty etc., should be determined from the Lagna and the sign occupied by the \\n\\nMoon. It is from the 7th place (from the Lagna or the Moon whichever is stronger) \\n\\nthat her welfare (happiness) and the (nature of the husband) should be assertained.\\n\\n115\\n\\n\\x0cJataka Parijata\\n\\nWhatever effect may accrue from the horoscope of female that is applicable \\n\\nonly to men, should be ascribed to the husband. The good and evil affecting their \\n\\nperson should be calculated from the Moon and the Lagna whichever of them is \\n\\nstronger. It is from the 7th place from the Lagna or the Moon that all that is worthy \\n\\nor unworthy in the husband should be ascertained and the death of the husband is \\n\\nforetold through the 8th bhava (from the Lagna or the Moon). All this should be \\n\\nwell weighted by the strength or weakness of the planets, benefic and malefic, \\n\\nbefore an announcement is made.\\n\\nOf the Lagna and the Moon, find which is stronger. It is well reference to the \\n\\nluck, beauty and strenght of women should be announced. Children and wealth in \\n\\nabundance should be declared through the 9th bhava therefrom. Wedded happiness \\n\\nor otherwise should be gathered from the 8th bhava; husband\\'s fortune from the \\n\\n7th. Some astrologers opine that the well being or the reverse of the husband can \\n\\nbe determined from the 9th bhava.\\n\\nSome hold that widowhood is found out through the 8th bhava. Beauty, fame \\n\\nand fortune through the Lagna, the son through the 5th, ascertain as well exceeding \\n\\ntranquility   of   women   through   the   planets   occupying   the   9th   bhava.  All   else \\n\\nwhether due to the bhavas or yogas are the same in regard to both men and women.\\n\\nBrihat Parasara Hora Shastra\\n\\nThe physique of the woman should be ascertained from the Lagna, offspring \\n\\nfrom the 5th, happiness of the husband from the 7th and widowhood from 6th. \\n\\nThose effects which are not applicable to women should be ascertained to their \\n\\nhusbands.\\n\\nWe would like to comment on two of the various matters described above.\\n\\n(1) Whether the effects not applicable to women should be ascertained to \\n\\ntheir husbands.\\n\\n(2) From which house should we examine matters relating to children.\\n\\nAs   regards   (1)   the   time   have   now   completely   changed   and   women   now \\n\\nenjoy equal opportunities in all fields. Now women are holding high posts in the \\n\\n116\\n\\n\\x0cscientific, engineering, financial and administrative spheres. We are, therefore, of \\n\\nthe view that the effects of Raja Yogas, Adhiyogas, etc., present in their horoscopes \\n\\nshould be aplicable to them and not to their husbands. They can apply to husbands \\n\\nin case they are entirely dependent on them.\\n\\nAs regards (2) the most appropriate and logical house from which the matter \\n\\nof children should be examined, is the 5th house and in this sphere no distinction \\n\\nshould be made between male\\'s and female\\'s horoscope. The view of Parasara as \\n\\ngiven   in   the   Brihat   Parasara   Hora   Shastra   should   be   treated   as   the   most \\n\\nauthoritative.   Birhat   Jataka   is   silent   about   this   which   means   that   it   makes   no \\n\\ndifferentiation   between   a   male\\'s   horoscope   and   female\\'s   horoscope   about   this \\n\\nmatter. Saravali has followed the view expressed in Brihat Parasara Hora Shastra.\\n\\n2. If in a female\\'s nativity both the Ascendant and the Moon are in even \\n\\nsigns and be aspected by benefics, the native will be blessed with good sons and \\n\\nhusband will be of good character and will wear ornaments. She will be prosperous \\n\\nand will possess praiseworthy qualities. If, however, both the Ascendant and the \\n\\nMoon be in odd signs and be aspected by malefics, the woman concerned will be \\n\\nmasculine in bearing, of wicked disposition, beyond the control of the husband, \\n\\ninsincere, wrathful and poor.\\n\\n3. If the 7th house or the setting navamsa be owned by a benefic, the woman \\n\\nborn will be blessed with a husband who will be handsome, well reputed, learned \\n\\nand wealthy. If it be otherwise, the husband will be deformed, stupid, deceitful and \\n\\npoor and the native will be separated from her husband. If Mars be posited there, \\n\\nshe will become a widow, both benefics and malefics occupy the 7th house, she \\n\\nwill remarry. If there be a malefic or malefics in the 8th house, she will get a \\n\\nshortlived husband. If the 2nd house is occupied by malefics, the native dies with \\n\\nher husband.\\n\\nNote-it is believed that if the mischief of Mars, Saturn, Rahu, Ketu and the \\n\\nSun be similar in the horoscopes of both husband and wife, they are not harmed in \\n\\nany way.\\n\\n4. If in a female\\'s nativity, the Moon is in Taurus, Leo, Virgo or Scorpio \\n\\n117\\n\\n\\x0cidentical with the 5th house, the native will have a limited number of Issues. If the \\n\\n7th house or the setting navamsa belongs to Saturn, Mars or the Sun, the native \\n\\nwill have a diseased sexual organ. If the 4th house be occupied by malefic planets, \\n\\nthe native will be unchaste.\\n\\nIf the Ascendant, \"the Moon and Venus beta a sign or navamsa of Saturn or \\n\\nMars, the native will become a prostitute.\\n\\n5. If the 7th house or the setting navamsa belongs to be benefic, the female \\n\\nborn, will have beautiful hips and will be very fortunate.\\n\\nIf the Moon, the Ascendant and the 4th house be connected with benefics \\n\\n(by conjunction, lordship or aspects), the woman concerned will be chaste and will \\n\\npossess excellent qualities.\\n\\nIf benefics be posited in trikonas, the native will be happy, will be blessed \\n\\nwith sons (children), full of good qualities and wealthy. If there be malefics in the \\n\\nabove mentioned houses, she will either be barren or she will give birth to still \\n\\nborn children.\\n\\n6-8. Find out which of the Moon and the Lagna is stronger. The one which is \\n\\nstronger   if   (i)   in  Aries   or   Scorpio   and   in   the   trimsamsa   of   Mars   the   woman \\n\\nconcerned will be ill-behaved. If it be in the trimsamsa of Saturn she will be maid \\n\\nservant. If it be in trimsamsa of Jupiter she will be cultured and wealthy. If it be in \\n\\nthe trimsamsa of Mercury, she will be deceitful and if it be in the trimsamsa of \\n\\nVenus she will be of bad character.\\n\\nIf the Moon or Lagna. whichever is stronger, is in Taurus or Libra in the \\n\\ntrimsamsa   of   Mars,   the   woman   concerned   will   be   of   bad   character,   in   the \\n\\ntrimsamsa of Saturn she will resort to another husband, in the trimsamsa of Jupiter, \\n\\nshe will be respected, in the trimsamsa of Mercury, she will be learned and in the \\n\\ntrisamsa of Venus she will be famous.\\n\\nIf the Moon or the Lagna, whichever is stronger, be in Gemini or Virgo, in \\n\\nthe trimsamsa of Mars she will be deceitful, in the trimsamsa of Saturn she will be \\n\\neunuch,   in   the   trimsamsa   of   Jupiter,   she   will   be   chaste,   in   the   trimsamsa   of \\n\\nMercury she will be full of good qualities and in the trimsamsa of Venus she will \\n\\n118\\n\\n\\x0cbe repining.\\n\\nIf the Moon or Lagna, whichever is stronger, be in Cancer, in the trimsamsa \\n\\nof Mars she will be self willed and uncontrolled, in the trimsamsa of Saturn she \\n\\nwill   kill   her   husband,   in   the   trimsamsa   of   Jupiter,   she   will   be   endowed   with \\n\\ndistinguished qualities, in the trimsamsa of Mercury, she will be skilled in arts and \\n\\nin the trimsamsa of Venus, she will be full of virtues.\\n\\nIf the Moon or the Lagna, whichever is stronger, be in Sagittarius or Pisces \\n\\nin the trimsamsa of Mars, she will be maid servant, in the trimsamsa of Saturn she \\n\\nwill be enamoured of persons other than her husband. In the trimsamsa of Jupiter \\n\\nshe will possess many good qualities, in the trimsamsa of Saturn she will have \\n\\nlittle desire for sexual intercourse, in the trimsamsa of Jupiter, she will be endowed \\n\\nwith many good qualities, in the trimsamsa of Mercury she will be skilled in the \\n\\narts, and in the trimsamsa of Venus she will be very chaste.\\n\\nIf the Moon or the Lagna, whichever is stronger, be in the Capricorn or \\n\\nAquarius, in the trimsamsa of Mars, she will be a maid servant; in the trimsamsa of \\n\\nSaturn, she will be enamoured of persons other than her husband; in the trimsamsa \\n\\nof   Jupiter,   she   will   keep   her   husband   under   her   control;   in   the   trimsamsa   of \\n\\nMercury she will be unchaste and in the trimsamsa of Venus she will be issueless \\n\\nand poor.\\n\\nIf the Moon or the Lagna, whichever is stronger, be in Leo, in the trimsamsa \\n\\nof Mars she will be a wicked wife; in the trimsamsa of Saturn she will be without \\n\\nany character; in the trimsamsa of Jupiter she will be wife of king or landlord; in \\n\\nthe   trimsamsa   of   Mercury   she   will   be   masculine   in   her   behaviour   and   in   the \\n\\ntrimsamsa of Venus she will have attachment for a person other than her husband.\\n\\n9. The elder brother of the husband, the mother-in-law, father-in-law and \\n\\nyounger brother will die (soon after the marriage), if the girl is born in Jyestha, \\n\\nAshlesha, Moola and Vishakha nakshatras respectively.\\n\\nThe   girls   born   in   Chitra,  Ardra,   Satabhisha,   Jyestha,   Moola,   Kritika   or \\n\\nPushyami nakshatras will become, barrens, widows, mothers whose children do \\n\\nnot survive, cast away by husbands or poor.\\n\\n119\\n\\n\\x0c10. If the Moon, lords of the Ascendant, the 7th and the 9th house associated \\n\\nwith benefics be posited In good houses and be of brilliant rays (not eclipsed), the \\n\\nwoman concerned will be held in high esteem by her relations. She will do many \\n\\ngood deeds, will be very pretty and be prosperous. She will please her husband, \\n\\nbear good sons and be virtuous in her disposition, the period of this happy life with \\n\\ndepending   on   the   strength   derived   by   the   eighth   house   from   benefics   through \\n\\nassociation or aspect.\\n\\n11. If a woman\\'s menses commences when the Moon is in an Anupachaya \\n\\nhouse (1, 2. 4, 5, 7, 8, 9 and 12) and is aspected by Mars, they (menses) become \\n\\nfavourable to conception and not otherwise.\\n\\nThe husband should sow the seed when the Moon occupies an Upachaya \\n\\nhouse (3, 6, 10, 11) in respect of the female\\'s nativity and is aspected by Jupiter. \\n\\nThis is to be done at an auspicious Lagna with many good points in its favour and \\n\\nunconnected with (Parva) and other objectionable period of time.\\n\\nThus ends the eleventh  chapter on \"Women Horoscopy\" in Phaladeepika  \\n\\ncomposed by Mantreswara.\\n\\n120\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 12\\n\\nMatters relating to the birth of Children\\n\\n(The 5th house)\\n\\n1. The native will assuredly be blessed with children as an effect of any of \\n\\nthe following planetary dispositions:\\n\\n(1) If Jupiter and lords of the 5th with reference to the Lagna and the Moon \\n\\nbe well placed and the 5th house has the aspect of a benefic planet or a planet \\n\\nowning an auspicious house (i.e. other than the 6th. 8th or 12th). or\\n\\n(2) If the lords of the Lagna and the 5th house are placed together in a house \\n\\nor   have   mutual   benefic   aspect   and   have   interchanged   positions   amongst \\n\\nthemselves.\\n\\n2. The native will have no issue in the following circum stances:\\n\\n(1)  When   the   5th   house   reclined   from   Lagna,   the   Moon   and   Jupiter   are \\n\\nassociated with or aspected by malefics without any benefic association or aspect.\\n\\n(2) When the above houses are hemmed in between malefics.\\n\\n(3) When the lords of these houses are in 6th, 8th or 12th.\\n\\n3. If a malefic lord of the 5th house, occupies it. the native will be blessed \\n\\nwith children.\\n\\nWhen the 5th house is occupied by a malefic, the person concerned will \\n\\nhave sons in plenty.\\n\\nIf a benefic lord of the 5th house occupies his own house or be in his sign of \\n\\nexaltation in that house, there will be loss of children.\\n\\nThe signs Scorpio, Leo and Virgo when they represent the 5th house are \\n\\ntermed as childless signs and will give a limited number of children and that also \\n\\nafter a long interval.\\n\\nNotes: We find it difficult to believe that a benefic planet as lord of the 5th \\n\\nwill destroy the progeny when he happens to occupy his own house. According to \\n\\nShri   Gopesh   Kumar   Ojha   that   if   a   benefic   lord   of   the   5th   occupies   the   5th \\n\\nalongwith a malefic, there is loss of children. Even this has not been found correct \\n\\n121\\n\\n\\x0cin our experience. Please see in this connection the following horoscope.\\n\\nHere the 5th lord Venus is a benefic. He occupies his own house with Mars \\n\\nand Moon (waning) both malefics. The native is blessed with children.\\n\\nRahu\\n\\nSat\\n\\nL\\n\\nKetu\\n\\nSun \\nMerc\\nJup\\n\\nMoon \\nMars \\nVen\\n\\n4. The native will have a child late to life after a great effect  under the \\n\\nfollowing circumstances:\\n\\n(1) When the Sun be in the 5th in a childless sign and Saturn and Mars be in \\n\\nthe 8th and the Ascendant respectively.\\n\\n(2) When the 5th house falls in a childless sign and Saturn, Jupiter, and Mars \\n\\nbe to the Ascendant, the 8th and 12th respectively.\\n\\n(3) When there be the Moon in the 11th, a malefic the 5th from Jupiter be \\n\\noccupied by a malefic and the several planets occupy the Ascendant.\\n\\n(2) When the 5th house falls in a childless sign and Saturn. Jupiter, and Mars \\n\\nbe in the Ascendant, the 8th and 12th respectively.\\n\\n(3) When there be the Moon in the 11th. a malefic in the 5th from Jupiter be \\n\\noccupied by a malefic and the several planets occupy the Ascendant.\\n\\n5. The native will have children  after second marriage if Mars or Venus \\n\\nalone occupies the 5th house identical with Cancer.\\n\\nSaturn alone in Cancer in the 5th house gives many sons. Mercury alone in \\n\\nCancer in the 5th house gives very few sons.\\n\\n122\\n\\n\\x0cThe Moon alone in his own sign in the 5th house gives a limited number of \\n\\nsons.\\n\\nJupiter singly in his sign of exaltation gives many daughters.\\n\\n6. The following four planetary combinations led to the extinction of the \\n\\nfamily:—\\n\\n(1) A malefic in the 4th, Venus in the 7th and the Moon in the 10th.\\n\\n(2) Malefics in the Ascendant, the 5th, 8th and 12th.\\n\\n(3) Mercury and Venus in the 7th, Jupiter in the 5th and malefics in the 4th.\\n\\n(4) The Moon in the 5th and malefics in the Ascendant, the 8th and 12th.\\n\\n7. If the malefics occupy the Ascendant, the lord of the Ascendant\\n\\nbe in the 5th. the lord of the 5th in the 3rd and the Moon in the 4th, the \\n\\nnative will be devoid of any issue.\\n\\nShould the Moon occupy the 5th house in an odd sign or an odd navamsa \\n\\nand be aspected by the Sun. the native will either be issuless or will be distressed \\n\\non account of issues.\\n\\n8. The native will have a son by adoption under the following planetary \\n\\ndispositions:—\\n\\n(1) If the 5th house be identical with Gemini. Virgo, Capricorn or Aquarius \\n\\nand be occupied or aspected by Saturn or Mandi.\\n\\n(2) If the lord of the 5th house be weak and be in no way connected with the \\n\\nlords of the Ascendant and the 7th.\\n\\n9.   The   native   will   have   to   suffer   loss   of   children   in   the   following \\n\\ncircumstances:—\\n\\n(1) If the lord of the 5th be in his sign of debilitation or in an inimical sign or \\n\\nbe associated with any of the lords of the 6th, 8th or 12th.\\n\\n(2) The lord of the 5th is in the 5th without receiving any benefic aspect.\\n\\n10. If the lord of the 5th house. Jupiter. Mars and the Sun (they may be \\n\\nanywhere) are posited in male navamsas, the native will be blessed with many \\n\\nsons. So say the sages. The nature good or otherwise of the sons will depend on the \\n\\nstrength of the 5th house.\\n\\n123\\n\\n\\x0c11. If the 5th house or its lord be in a male sign or navamsa or be associated \\n\\nwith and aspected by male planets, the native will have all male issues. There will \\n\\nbe birth of daughter if the 5th or its lord be in a female sign or navamsa or be \\n\\nassociated with or aspected by female planets.\\n\\n12. Conception may take place when the Sun and Venus in a male\\'s nativity \\n\\nand Mars and Venus in the case of a female\\'s nativity are vested with adequate \\n\\nstrength and pass their signs or navamsas identical with an upachaya house.\\n\\n13. The number of issues is to be ascertained by examining the number of \\n\\nplanets in the 5th house and at the sometime that are not (1) inimical (2) in their \\n\\nsign   of   debilitation   and   (3)   in   inimical   navamsa.   The   same   could   also   be \\n\\nascertained by study of the number of planets similarly situated but in conjunction \\n\\nwith the lord of the 5th house.\\n\\nThe study of benefic dots of planets in the 5th house from Jupiter or the \\n\\nnavamsa occupied by the Sun, also enables one to guess the number of issues. ln \\n\\nthis   verse   is   explained   the   method   of   ascertaining   female   and   male   nativities \\n\\nwhettor they are physically capable of producing children.\\n\\n14. In the case of a female nativity add the longitudes (spast) of the Moon, \\n\\nMars   and   Jupiter.   If   the   result   comes   to   an   even   sign   and   even   navamsa,   the \\n\\nstrength of fecundity in the female for producing issues is assured. If it is mixed \\n\\n(i.e. sign male and navamsa female or vice versa), she will be able to produce \\n\\nchildren after great effort.\\n\\nIn the case of a male nativity if the sum total of the longitudes of the Sun, \\n\\nVenus and Jupiter denotes an odd sign and an odd navamsa, it is Indicative of the \\n\\nstrong physical capacity of the male to produce children and in case one of the two \\n\\n(sign and navamsa) be even, the result will be mixed.\\n\\nNotes — If in the case of female nativity the sum total denotes odd sign and \\n\\nodd   navamsa,   and   in   a   male\\'s   nativity   the   result   signifies   even   sign   and   even \\n\\nnavamsa, their physical capacity to produce children will be almost nil or very \\n\\nweak.\\n\\n15.   Subtract   five   times   the   longitude   of   the   Sun   from   five   times   the \\n\\n124\\n\\n\\x0clongitude of the Moon. If the Tithi represented by the result be an auspicious one in \\n\\nthe bright half of the lunar month, the native will definitely have progeny without \\n\\nmuch effort. But if the resulting Tithi be one of the dark half of the month, the \\n\\neffect will be taken to be negative. It is by close examination of the Tithi-whether it \\n\\nis auspicious or is auspicious in both the Pakshas — bright and dark — that one \\n\\nhas to ascertain whether the native will have issues or not. During an Amavasya, a \\n\\nChidra Tithi, the Vishti karana or any of the Sthlra karanas, there will be no Issue \\n\\nat all.\\n\\nNotes—The   Chidra  Tithis   are   (1)   Chaturthi,   (2)   Shasti,   (3)  Ashtami,   (4) \\n\\nNavami, (5) Dwadashi and (6) Chaturdashi. These days are generally avoided for \\n\\nany auspicious function.\\n\\nThere are 11 karanas distributed over the 30 Tithis of the lunar month at the \\n\\nrate of 2 karanas for each Tithi. The four of these (1) Chatuspada, (2) Nagava. (3) \\n\\nKirnstugne and (4) Sakune are called Sthira karanas and are so named as they \\n\\npermanently hold two over the four half Tithis commencing from the second half \\n\\nof Krishna  Paksha Chaturdashi. The other seven viz.. (1)  Bava (2) Balava, (3) \\n\\nKailava, (4) Tatthila, (5) Garaya, (6) Vaniya and (7) Vishta or Bhadra are called \\n\\nChar or movable karanas and occur In 8 cycles to preside over the remaining 56 \\n\\nhalf   —   to   this   of   the   lunar   month   beginning   the   later   half   of   Shukla   paksha \\n\\nprathama.\\n\\nRemedial Measures\\n\\n16-18. Should, however, the result happen to be one of the Chidra Tithis, the \\n\\nVlshtl Karana or a Sthir Karana, the remedial measure to worship lord Krishna by \\n\\nrecitation  of Purusha  Sukta  Mantras to ward off the barrenness threatening  the \\n\\nfaimty.   If   the   resultant  Tlthl   comes   out   to   be   Shastl,   the   native   ought   to   offer \\n\\nprayers to God Subramanya. If it be Chaturthi the lord of the Serpents has to be \\n\\nappeased. If It be navami, the recitation of Ramayana and listening to Ramayana is \\n\\nthe remedy. If it is Ashtami, the Sravana Vrata by fasting has to be observed. If it \\n\\nbe Chaturdasi the native should worship God Rudra (Shiva) by Rudraparayana. If \\n\\nthe Tithi be Dwadashi he should appease the gods by feeding the needy. If it be \\n\\n125\\n\\n\\x0cAmavasya or Poornamasi the Manes have to be propitiated. These measures are \\n\\nabsolutely essential to be observed with greater care and attention when the Tithi \\n\\nhappens   to   be   one   among   the   last   five,   namely   after   Krishna   paksha   Dasami. \\n\\nGenerally, In the dark half of a month to which so ever of the three division a Tithi \\n\\nmay belong, worship ought to be resorted to: the particular deity to be propitiated \\n\\nbeing Nagaraja in the first division, namely l-5Tlthi, Skanda in the second (next \\n\\nfive Tithis i.e. 6-10) and Hari in the third or last five.\\n\\n19. If in any nativity, the lord of the 5th house be in his inimical or sign of \\n\\ndebilitation,   be   combust   or   be   posited   in   6th,   8th   or   12th   house   there   is   no \\n\\npossibility   of   native   getting   an   issue.   If   the   planet   in   the   5th   house   be   in   his \\n\\ninimical   sign   or   sign   of   debilitation   or   be   the   lord   of   the   6th,   8th   or   12th. \\n\\nchildlessness will be the definite consequence. He ought to divine the source of the \\n\\nsame by an examination of the particular deity, tree and animal represented by the \\n\\nsign occupied by the planet.\\n\\n20-22. If the obstacle causing planet is the Sun, the person concerned will be \\n\\nsonless due to disrespect shown to God Shiva and Garuda  and the  consequent \\n\\ncurse of the Manes. If such a planet be the Moon, it will be due to displeasure and \\n\\nanger of the mother, Sumangli or other respectful woman owing to her feelings \\n\\nhaving been hurt. If the planet concerned be Mars, tt will be due to some fault due \\n\\nto the village deity, to God Kartikeya, to an enemy or one\\'s Dayadins. In the case \\n\\nof Mercury, the sonlessness will be due to crimes of youngester or to the killing of \\n\\nspawns (eggs of fishes and similar creatures), or the displeasure of God Vishnu. If \\n\\nthe cause of sonlessness be due to Jupiter, it will be due to harm caused to the \\n\\nhereditary Brahma family priest or the destruction of a tree full of fruits. If the \\n\\nchildlessness causing be Venus, it will be due to cutting of a tree full of flowers or \\n\\nharm to a virtuous woman or to the cows or a sinful deed to people that ought to be \\n\\nrevered. If Saturn be the planet responsible for causing childlessness, it will be due \\n\\nto the destruction of an Aswatha or Peepal tree or on account of wrath of yama or \\n\\nthrough departed spirits, goblins and the like. If Rahu should occupy the 5th house \\n\\nor be associated with the lord of that house, it will be due to the curse of a serpent. \\n\\n126\\n\\n\\x0cIn the case of Ketu, it will be owing to the curse of a serpent. In the case of Ketu, it \\n\\nwill be owing to the curse of a Brahmin. If Mandi be the cause of obstruction, it \\n\\nwill be due to the curse of departed spirits. If Venus and the Moon in conjunction \\n\\nwith Mandi should cause childlessness, it will be on account of the killing of a \\n\\nwoman or a cow. If Jupiter or Ketu in conjuction with Mandi be in the 5th house, \\n\\nthe sonlessness will be due to the killing of a Brahmin.\\n\\n23. The sins accured by one\\'s actions in many previous births have been \\n\\ndescribed in nativity which lead to childlessness and to ward off which and to \\n\\nsecure a son, the learned in Astrology have recommended particular Japs, Charities \\n\\nand such other good action prescribed for several planets.\\n\\n24.   A   holy   bath   in   Rameshwaram,   engaging   oneself   in   reciting   holy \\n\\nscriptures, worhsip of God Shiva, observation of holy austerities with reference to \\n\\n(propitiate)   God   Vishnu,   Charities,   ceremonies   in   honour   of   departed   souls, \\n\\ninstallation   of   the   serpent   deity   —   these   are   various   remedial   measures \\n\\nrecommended by which one can be blessed with sons (children).\\n\\n25. The birth of a son should possibly take place in the dasha or antar dasha \\n\\nof any of the following planets:-\\n\\n(1) The lord of the ascendent, (2) the lord of the 7th house, (3) the lord of the \\n\\n5th   house,   (4)   Jupiter,   (5)   the   planet   aspecting   the   5th   house,   (6)   the   planet \\n\\noccupying the 5th house.\\n\\nWhen   Jupiter   passes   through   in   transit   the   triangular   sign   to   the   sign \\n\\noccupied   by   the   lord   of   the   5th   or   yama   kantaka,   birth   of   a   son   may   also   be \\n\\nexpected.\\n\\n26. The birth of a son is likely to take place, when the lord of the ascendant \\n\\nduring his transit (1) gets into conjunction with the lord of the 5th house, (2) passes \\n\\nthrough his sign of exaltation or (3) occupies his own sign passing through in his \\n\\ntransit of the ascendant through the 5th house or the sign occupied by the lord of \\n\\nthe 5th is also an opportune period for the birth of children.\\n\\n27. Add the longitudes of (1) the lord of the ascendant, (2) the lord of the 7th \\n\\nhouse, and (3) the lord of the 5th house. During the course of the major period \\n\\n127\\n\\n\\x0crepresented   by   the   owner   of   the   nakshatra   resulting   from   the   sum  total   of   the \\n\\nlongitudes   of   the   above   plantes   and   in   the   sub-period   of   any   of   the   following \\n\\nplanets will the birth of a son (children) take place—\\n\\n(1) The planet occupying the 5th house,\\n\\n(2) the planet aspecting the 5th house and\\n\\n(3) the lord of the 5th.\\n\\n28. Find out which amongst the (1) lord of the 5th house, (2) the lord of the \\n\\nsign occupied by the lord of the 5th house and (3) the lord of the navamsa of the \\n\\nlord of the 5th house (4) the lord of the sign occupied by jupiter and (5) the lord of \\n\\nthe navamsa occupied by Jupiter is a strong planet. The birth of a son (children) \\n\\nmay be expected in the major or sub-period of this strong planet.\\n\\n29. Find out the sign of 5th from Jupiter and the sign and navamsa of its \\n\\nlord. When Jupiter in transit is triangular to that sign or navamsa, the birth of a son \\n\\n(children) may be predicted.\\n\\nAccording   ta   other   authorities   on   the   subject,   a   learned   man   ought   to \\n\\ninvestigate indications of the birth of children from the positions of the planet at \\n\\nthe time of the birth of the native.\\n\\n30. Find out the lord of the nakshatra occupied by the Moon and that of the \\n\\n5th from it. Add the longitudes of the two plantes. When Jupiter passes in transit \\n\\nthrough the sign represented by this result or through one of its triangular ones, the \\n\\nbirth of a son is possible.\\n\\n31. The birth of a son (child) is likely to take place when the Sun In his \\n\\ntransit   passes   the   third   sign   representing   the   Nisheka   Lagna   or   transits   a   sign \\n\\ntriangular to the Adhana Lagna.\\n\\n32. If the birth of a son takes place In a Lagna which is 5th or 9th to the \\n\\nAdhana,   it   should   be   understood   that   such   a   birth   Is   due   to   virtuous   deeds \\n\\nperformed in the previous births.\\n\\nIf the Adhana Lagna is occupied or aspected by benefics, the person born \\n\\nwill be longlived, wealthy and happy.\\n\\n33. Find out the exact Dwadasamsa of the Mars at the time of Adhana and \\n\\n128\\n\\n\\x0cthe sign in which he was posited (count from Aries or from this sign as many signs \\n\\nas the number represented by Dwadasamsa in question). When Moon Is In the sign \\n\\nso found in the month  of delivery, the birth of the child to the womb may  be \\n\\nprotected.\\n\\n34. The prediction should be made from the consideration of the positions of \\n\\nthe serveral planets with reference to the Moon and the Lagna at the time of a \\n\\nquery, adoption of a son. investiture of sacred thread, the gift of a girl, the first \\n\\nmaturity or the time of conception, as he would if a birth had taken place at the \\n\\ntime.\\n\\nThus ends the twelfth chapter on \"Progeny \"in Phaladeeplka composed by  \\n\\nMantreswara.\\n\\n129\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 13\\n\\nDetermination of Longevity\\n\\n1.   The   first   thing   to   be   considered   after   the   birth   of   the   child   is   the \\n\\nexamination   of   his   longevity.   The   other   effects   should   be   judged   later.   If   the \\n\\nnativity indicates some merits like Raja Yoga etc., their effects should be assessed \\n\\nin consultation with those who are proficient in the knowledge of Astrology.\\n\\n2. There is difference of opinion about the actual time of birth of the child. \\n\\nThe various views are —\\n\\n(1) The time of birth is that when the head (of the infant) emerges.\\n\\n(2) The time of birth is that when the body of the infant emerges and touches \\n\\nthe ground.\\n\\n(3)  The   time   of   birth   is   that   when   the   body   of   the   infant   is   completed, \\n\\nseparated from the mother\\'s womb.\\n\\n3. In the case of human beings, it is not possible to determine the longevity \\n\\nof a child within the first twelve years. Even if the nativity shows good longevity, \\n\\nthe child meets his death owing to the sinful actions of the parents (during this or \\n\\nprevious births).\\n\\n4. If the child dies within the first four year it will be due to the mother\\'s \\n\\nsins. Death taking place between four to eight year will be due to the sins of the \\n\\nfather. If the death takes place between eight and twelve years, it will be due to the \\n\\nnative\\'s own sinful actions in the previous births.\\n\\n5. With a view to escape from the evil effects described above the father \\n\\nshould resort to remedial measures mentioned below to promote the longevity of \\n\\nthe child and for his protection. The father should arrange for the performance of \\n\\nreligious rites preceded by the incantations of mantras and offerings of oblations \\n\\nby   the   pouring   of   ghee   etc.,   in   the   holy   fire   on   every,   birth   day   of   the   child \\n\\n(according to lunar month) till the 12th year. This should be suppplemented by \\n\\nappropriate medical treatment where necessary.\\n\\n6. The first eight year\\'s period of a man\\'s life is treated as Balarishta. Thus \\n\\n130\\n\\n\\x0cthat afflict him till the 20th year are said to be due to Yogarishta (evils produced by \\n\\nplanetary dispositions). When the longevity extends to 32, it is called alpayus or \\n\\nshort life. It is called Madhyamayus or middle age when the span of life extends to \\n\\n70 years. It is Poornayus when the period of life extends to 100 years.\\n\\n7. A hundred years is generally recognised as the span of life for human \\n\\nbeings. The division of this period Into three portions constitutes respectively the \\n\\nAlpayu, Madhyamayu and Poornayu and this is recognised universally.\\n\\n8.   If   the   birth   occurs   in   the   evil   yogas   -   Dinamrityu,   Dinaroga   or \\n\\nVishaghatikala, the child will die immediately after birth.\\n\\nNotes— Described below are the Dinamrityu, Dinaroga and Vishagatikala \\n\\nYogas.\\n\\nDina mrityu— There is this yoga when the birth is during the day in the first \\n\\nquarter of Dhanishta and hasta, in the 2nd quarter of Uttarabhadra and Ashlesha, \\n\\nand the fourth quarter of Bharani and Moola. These yogas do not cause any evil \\n\\neffect if the birth is during the night.\\n\\nDinaroga — There is this yoga when the birth occurs during the day in the \\n\\nfirst quarter of Ashlesha and Uttarabhadra, in the second quarter of Bharani and \\n\\nMoola, in the third quarter of Uttaraphalguni and Sravana and in the fourth quarter \\n\\nof Swati and Mrigashira. These yogas will cause no evil effects if the birth occurs \\n\\nduring the night.\\n\\nVishagatikala — Every nakshatra has ghatikas of Vishagatikala as under —\\n\\nAswin 50-54, Bharani 24-28, Krittika 30-34, Rohini 40-44, Mrigashira 14-\\n\\n18, Aridra 21-25, Punarvasu 30-34, Pushyami 20-24, Ashlesha 32-36, Makha 30-\\n\\n34,   Poorvaphalguni   20-24,   Uttaraphalguni   18-22,   Hasta   21-25,   Chlttra   20-24, \\n\\nSwati   14-18,   Visakha   14-18.,  Anuradha   10-14,   Jyestha   14-18,   Mcx)la   56-60, \\n\\nPoorvashada   24-281   Uttarashada   20-24,   Saravana   10-14,   Dhanista   10-14, \\n\\nShatabhlsha 18-22, Poorvabhadra 16-20, Uttarabhadra 24-28 and Revati 30-34.\\n\\nIf the birth occurs in the first quarter of Pushyami, Poorvashada and Chittra, \\n\\nthe father of the native dies. If it be in the second quarter, the mother dies. The \\n\\nchild will himself die if the birth takes place in the third quarter. The maternal \\n\\n131\\n\\n\\x0cuncle will die if the birth be in the fourth quarter of these nakshatra.\\n\\nIf the Ascendant is not connected with benefic planets and birth takes place \\n\\nin Moola or Ashlesha nakshatras the results will be as follows:—\\n\\nMoola first \\nquarter \\nMoola second \\nquarter \\nMoola third \\nquarter \\nMoola fourth \\nquarter \\n\\nAshlesha fourth \\nquarter \\nAshlesha third \\nquarter \\nAshlesha \\nsecond quarter \\nAshlesha first \\nquarter \\n\\nDeath of the \\nfather \\nDeath of the \\nmother \\nExtinction of \\nthe family \\nWealthy and \\nprosperous. \\n\\n9. If the birth takes place at the time of Sandhi (junction) of the signs and if \\n\\nthe signs be not aspected by or associated with  benefics the child born dies soon \\n\\nafter birth.\\n\\nIf the birth occurs in Gandanta the death takes place either of the parents or \\n\\nthe native himself. If, however, the native survives he becomes splendourous like a \\n\\nking (The sandhis between Pisces and Aries, Cancer and Leo and Scorpio and \\n\\nSagittarius are called gandanta). The person, who is born in Sandhi associated with \\n\\nor aspected by malefics will not see Sunrise. The same result may be expected if \\n\\nthe Moon at birth attains tne fateful degree in any sign and is at the same time \\n\\nposited in a Kendra or the 8th house.\\n\\n10.   Jf   the   degrees   attained   by   the   Moon   in  Aries   and   the   other   sign   be \\n\\nrespectively 26, 12, 13, 25, 24, 11, 26, 14, 13, 25, 5 and 12, they indicate death.\\n\\n11. The following are (also) respectively deemed as Mrityubhagas or fateful \\n\\ndegrees of the Lagna in the several signs from Aries onwards 8, 9, 22, 22, 25, 14, \\n\\n4, 23, 18, 20, 21, and 10.\\n\\n12.   The   child   born   dies   soon   after   birth   in   the   following   planetary \\n\\ndispositions :—\\n\\n(1) If malefics be in the Kendra or the 8th.\\n\\n(2) If the Ascendant and the 8th are occupied by malefics.\\n\\n132\\n\\n\\x0c(3) If the Ascendant and the 7th are occupied by malefics.\\n\\n(4) If the Moon and the Ascendant be hemmed in between malefics.\\n\\n(5) If the waning Moon be posited in 6th, 8th or 12th.\\n\\n(6) If the waning Moon alongwith malefics occupies the 1st, 5th, 7th or the \\n\\n9th house.\\n\\n(7) If the malefics be posited in the 7th and 8th houses.\\n\\nIf, however, there be aspect of benefics on the Lagna, the Moon or malefics \\n\\nor there be benefics in Kendra, the evil effects described above do not come to \\n\\npass.\\n\\n13. If the lord of the Ascendant or the lord of the sign occupied by the Moon \\n\\nbeing weak is placed in 6th, 8th or 12th, the native survives for the number of the \\n\\nyears as are indicated by the number of the sign (counted from Aries) in which the \\n\\nLord of Lagna or the lord of the Moon sign is posited.\\n\\nIf the lord of the Lagna decanate or the lord of the Moon decanate being \\n\\nweak be placed in the 6th, 8th or 12th, the number of the sign in which such lord is \\n\\nposited will indicate the number of days of the survival of the child.\\n\\nIf the lord of the Lagna Navamsa or the lord of the Moon Navamsa being \\n\\nweak be placed in 6th, 8th or. 12th, the sign of the Lagna Navamsa or the Moon \\n\\nNavamsa will indicate the number of days of the survival of the native.\\n\\nAfter carefully taking into account which of the above planetary dispositions \\n\\nare more predominant and after considering the nature of the malefics occupying \\n\\nthe 5th and 8th house from the Lagna, a final decision should be taken about the \\n\\nlongevity of the native.\\n\\n14. Note the following 3 pairs (A) the decanate signs of the Lagna and the \\n\\nMoon.   (B)   the   Navamsa   signs   of   the   lord   of   the   Lagna   and   lord   of   the   sign \\n\\noccupied by the Moon and (C) the Dwadasasma signs of the lord of the Lagna and \\n\\nof the lord of the 8th house.\\n\\nThe life of the child should be pronounced as Deergha, Madhya and Alpa \\n\\naccording as (a) when one of the signs in the said 3 pairs is a moveable sign and \\n\\nthe other is a moveable fixed or dual sign, (b) when one of the signs is fixed and \\n\\n133\\n\\n\\x0cthe other is a dual, moveable or fixed sign and (c) when one of the signs is a dual \\n\\nsign and the other is a fixed, dual or moveable sign respectively.\\n\\nA \\nLagna Decanate sign \\nB \\nSign of the Lagna \\nNavamsa \\nC \\nDwadasamsa sign of the \\nlord of the Lagna. \\n\\nMoon Decanate sign \\n\\nSign of the Moon\\'s \\nNavamsa \\n\\nDwadasamsa sign of \\nthe lord of 8th. \\n\\nA Moveable  Moveable \\n  Moveable \\nFixed \\n  Moveable  Dual \\nDual \\nB Fixed \\nmoveable \\nfixed \\nfixed \\nfixed \\nFixed \\nC Dual \\nDual \\n  Dual \\nMoveable \\n  Dual \\n\\nDeergha \\nMadhya \\nAlpa \\nDeergha \\nMadhya \\nAlpa \\nDeergha \\nMadhya \\nAlpa \\n\\n15. If the lord of the Lagna and all the benefics be in Kendra the native will \\n\\nhave Deerghayu\\n\\nIf they be in Panphara house the native will have Madhyayu.\\n\\nIf they be in Apoklima house, the native will have Alpayu.\\n\\nIf the lord of the 8th house and all malefics be posited in Kendra house the \\n\\nnative will have Alphyu.\\n\\nIf they be posited in Panaphara house, the native will have Madhyayu.\\n\\nIf they be posited in Apoklima house, the native will enjoy Deerghayu.\\n\\nFind out if the following 3 pairs of planets are mutualy friends, neutrals or \\n\\nenemies:—\\n\\n(a) The lord of the sign in which the Moon is posited and the lord of the 8th \\n\\nhouse from the Moon sign.\\n\\n134\\n\\n \\n \\n\\x0c(b) The lord of the Lagna and the lord of the 8th house.\\n\\n(c) The lord of the Lagna and the Sun.\\n\\nThe native will enjoy Deerghayu if they are mutually friends. He will have \\n\\nMadhyayu if they are mutually neutrals and will have Alpayu if they are mutually \\n\\nenemies.\\n\\n16. The native will be longlived (enjoy Deerghayu) if —\\n\\n(1) The lord of the Lagna be stronger than the lord of the 8th house,\\n\\n(2) The lord of the rising Navamsa be stronger than the lord of the 8th from \\n\\nNavamsa Lagna,\\n\\n(3) If the lord of the sign occupied by the Moon be stronger than the lord of \\n\\nthe 8th from the Moon,\\n\\n(4) If the lord of the Moon\\'s Navamsa be stronger than Ihe lord of the 8th \\n\\nfrom it.\\n\\nIf otherwise, the reverse will be the result.\\n\\n17. If the lord of the 8th house endowed with greater strength than the lord \\n\\nof the lagna, be posited in Kendra and malefics occupy the 8th and the 12th, the \\n\\nnative will be shortlived even if he gets medicum life or prolog his life to the full \\n\\nperiod, his life will be the vicissitudes of happiness and misery.\\n\\n18.  Add   the   longitudes   of   the   Sun,   the   Moon,   Jupiter   and   Saturn.   For \\n\\nexample the following are the longitudes given in a horoscope.\\n\\nSun - 7-26, Moon - 11-20, Jupiter - 6-14, Saturn - 0-17, 26 or 2-7 that 7 \\n\\ndegrees of Gemini.\\n\\nIf the native has alpayu the end of his life will come when Saturn in transit \\n\\nreaches the first cycle of 7 degrees of Gemini.\\n\\n19. If the lord of the Lagna be associated with a maleifc and be eclipsed by \\n\\nthe Sun\\'s rays, or be in his sign of debilitation or in an inimical sign, the death of \\n\\nthe native will have to be pronounced, when the same lord in his transit happens to \\n\\noccupy the 6th, 8th or 12th or the Lagna or be some how connected with it. The \\n\\nsame event may also be deduced from the Navamsa Lagna, the decanate Lagna or \\n\\nthe sign in which the Moon be posited.\\n\\n135\\n\\n\\x0c20. If the Moon, the lord of the sign occupied by her and the lord of the \\n\\nLagna be all well placed by being associated with or aspected by benefics and \\n\\npassed   many   points   of   strength,   the   birth   at   that   time   should   be   treated   very \\n\\nauspicious and will make* the native happy in every way.\\n\\n21. If the lord of the Lagna possesses great strength and be unaspected by \\n\\n(or associated with) malefics and be aspected by (or associated with) benefics, \\n\\noccupies a kendra house, the death is warded off and the native secures a long life \\n\\nwith good qualities, wealth and an illusttrious or powerful sovereignty\\n\\n22. If Jupiter, the Minister of Gods, possessed of great strength and with \\n\\nbrilliant rays be posited in Lagna, he can singly ward off many of the evils which \\n\\notherwise would be difficult to overcome, just as a humble salutation placed with \\n\\nall sincerity before lord Vishnu demolishes all evils.\\n\\n23. If the birth be in bright half of the lumar month (Shukla Paksha) and the \\n\\nMoon   be   posited   in   1st,   4th,   5th,   7th,   9th,   10th   or   the   11th   in   Cancer,   Leo, \\n\\nSagittarius   or   Pisces   Navamsa,   many   evils   endangering   life   of   the   native   are \\n\\ndemolished and the birth becomes very auspicious.\\n\\n24. If in any nativity, there be no malefics in kendra, trikona and the 8th \\n\\nhouse and the lord of Lagna and Jupiter posited in kendra, the native performs \\n\\nvirtuous actions, enjoys all kinds of happiness and remains in good health with a \\n\\nlife span of 100 years.\\n\\n25.   Through   the   Dasas   enunciated   by   Spripati,   through   Ashtakavarga, \\n\\nthrough  Kalachakra   Dasa   and  through  the  Vimsottari  Dasa  system,  a  Wiseman \\n\\nought  to  predict  the  longevity  of the  native  by following  suitable  rules  after a \\n\\ncorrect   calculation   of   several   planetary   positions,   careful   working   and   minute \\n\\nscrutiny.\\n\\nThus ends the thirteenth chapter on \"Life Span\" in Phaladeepika composed  \\n\\nby Mantreswara.\\n\\n136\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 14\\n\\nDiseases, Death, Past and Future births\\n\\nThis   chapter   deals   with   planetary   dispositions   about   diseases,   death, \\n\\nprevious births and future births.\\n\\n1. All matters relating to diseases should be ascertained from (a) the planets \\n\\nin the 6th house, (b) the planets in the 8th house (c) the planets in the 12th house, \\n\\n(d) the lord of the 6th house and (e) the planets associated with the lord of the 6th \\n\\nhouse. The particular disease may be predicted if the same happens to be indicated \\n\\nby two, three or more independent planetary dispositions.\\n\\n2. The Sun is the significator for following diseases and troubles (1) bile, (2) \\n\\nhigh fever, (3) burning in the body, (4) epilepsy, (5) heart diseases, (6) eye troubles \\n\\n(7) stomach troubles, (8) skin diseases (9) lecorrhea, (10) danger from enemies, \\n\\n(11) danger from wood, fire, weapon and poison, (12) distress from wife and sons, \\n\\n(13) danger from thieves or quadrupeds, (14) danger from snakes (15) danger from \\n\\nthe king, the God Yama and God Shiva.\\n\\n3.

Mars can be the cause of following diseases and troubles (1) Excessive \\n\\nthirst, (2) morbid irritation due to billious fever, (3) fear or danger from fire, poison \\n\\nor weapon, (4) leprosy, (5) eye trebles, (6) appendicitis, (7) epilepsy, (8) injury to \\n\\nthe   marrow,   (9)   itch   in   the   body,   (10)   roughness   of   the   body,   (11)   bodily \\n\\ndeformities, (12) fear from the king, fire and thieves, (13) quarrels with brothers, \\n\\nsons or enemies, (14) fighting with the enemies, (15) diseases in the upper part of \\n\\nthe body and (16) fear from evil spirits, gandharva and frightful demon.\\n\\n137\\n\\n\\x0c5. Mercury is concerned with the following diseases and troubles (1) mental \\n\\nconfusion (2) harsh speech or trouble in vocal organs, (3) eye troubles, (4) diseases \\n\\nof   the   throat,   (5)   trouble   in   the   nose   or   nasal   affliction,   (6)   fever   caused   by \\n\\nimbalance of the three  humours — wind, bile and phlagm, (7) ill effects from \\n\\npoisoning (like food poisoning), (8) skin diseases, (9) jaundice, (10) itchning and \\n\\nbad dreams, (11) fear from fire. (12) hard labour, (13) diseases or evil caused by \\n\\ngandharvas etc.\\n\\n6.   Jupiter   is   responsible   for   the   following   diseases   and   troubles   (1) \\n\\nAppendicitis, (2) fever due to infection in intestines, (3) fainting, (4) diseases of \\n\\nthe ear, (5) troubles in connection with temple matters, (6) Distress due to curse of \\n\\nBrahmin (7) troubles due to hoarded wealth, (8) oppression caused by Vidyadhara, \\n\\nYakhsa, kinnaras, Gods, Serpents etc. (9) Punishment due to show of disrespect to \\n\\npreceptor, respected and elderly persona and deviation from duty towards them. \\n\\nThis is suffered during the Antar Dasa of Jupiter.

The diseases and troubles attributed to Rahu are as follows : (1) Heart \\n\\n138\\n\\n\\x0cdiseases, (2) theart of burning, (3) leprosy, (4) abarration of mind, (4) diseases \\n\\ncaused by poisoning, (5) pain  in the  legs or injury, (6)  distress from wife and \\n\\nchildren or distress caused on their account, (7) trouble from goblins, serpents or \\n\\nenemies.\\n\\nKetu   is   the   cause   of   (1)   Trouble   through   dispute   with   Brahmins   and \\n\\nKshatriyas.\\n\\nThe troubles due to Gulik are (1) fear from seeing dead bodies (2) poison, \\n\\n(3) bodily pain, (4) sorrow due to the death of a near relation, (5) fear from evil \\n\\nspirits.\\n\\n10. If the Moon and the Sun occupied the 2nd and 12th houses associated \\n\\nwith or aspected by Mars and Saturn, the native will suffer from eye diseases.\\n\\nNotes - If the planetary disposition described above is concerned with the \\n\\n12th house, the left eye will be affected. Similarly if any amongst the Sun and the \\n\\nMoon is posited in the 2nd or the 12th house and is aspected by Saturn or Mars, \\n\\nsuch Sun or Moon is in the 2nd house, the right eye will get afflicted. The left eye \\n\\nwill be adversely affected if their disposition be in the 12th house. If the Sun be in \\n\\nthe 2nd aspected by or associated with Mars or Saturn and the Moon be in the 12th \\n\\naspected by or associated with Mars or Saturn, both the eyes will get afflicted and \\n\\nmay even make the native blind.\\n\\nIf the 3rd and 11th houses and Jupiter be associated with or aspected by \\n\\nMars or Saturn, the native will suffer from diseases of the ears.\\n\\nThe native will suffer from stomach ache if the Mars be posited in the 5th \\n\\nhouse and be associated with the lord of the 6th or the 8th house.\\n\\nRectal disease, will be caused to the native if the lords of the 6th or the 8th \\n\\nhouse be posited in the 7th with a malefic or the lord of the 6th be in the 8th \\n\\nalongwith a malefic.\\n\\nVenus under the above condition will make the native suffer from a disease \\n\\nin the private parts (veneral diseases).\\n\\n11. If the 6th or 8th house be occupied by the Sun, there would be fear of \\n\\nfever, if by Mars or Ketu, the danger will be from injury or ulcer; if by Venus, it \\n\\n139\\n\\n\\x0cwill be through a disease in the private parts, if Jupiter should occupy the 6th or the \\n\\n8th house, the native will be afflicted with consumption; if Saturn be in such a \\n\\nposition, the native will suffer from nervous diseases. If Rahu aspected by Mars be \\n\\nin the 6th or  the  8th,  the  person concerned will suffer from carbuncle.  Should \\n\\nSaturn   alongwith   the   Moon   posited   in   6th   or   the   8th,   native   will   suffer   from \\n\\nenlargement of the spleen. If the waning Moon should occupy the 6th or the 8th \\n\\nhouse   identical   with   watery   sign,   in   conjunction   with   malefic;   the   person   will \\n\\nsuffer from watery diseases or consumption.\\n\\n12. I now proceed to explain the manner in which a person meets with his \\n\\ndeath and the cause of the same.\\n\\nThe   death   is  caused  through   the   diseases   caused   by   the   strongest  of  the \\n\\nplanets occupying or aspecting the 8th house.\\n\\nIf there be no planet occupying or aspecting the 8th house, the death will be \\n\\ncaused by the diseases signified by the 8th house or those indicated by the house in \\n\\nwhich the lord of the 8th house is placed.\\n\\nIf any of the  planetary  disposition do not exist, it may be declared with \\n\\ncertainty that death will be caused by the diseases caused by the lord of the 8th \\n\\nhouse, or by the lord of the 22nd decanate (counted from the Lagna decanate).\\n\\n13. When the 8th house is occupied or aspected by a planet, death should be \\n\\ndeclared to be caused by diseases relating to that planet. When there are no planets \\n\\noccupying  or aspecting the 8th house, death  is caused through  diseases arising \\n\\nfrom the nature of the sign representing the 8th house.\\n\\n14-15. The diseases or means through which death is caused by the various \\n\\nplanets are as under :—\\n\\n(1) The Sun — fire, high fever, bile or weapon\\n\\n(2) The Moon — Cholera, watery diseases or pulmonary disease\\n\\n(3) Mars — fire, magical spells, witchcraft and weapons.\\n\\n(4) Mercury—Anaemia, bloodlessness, and similar diseases and giddiness.\\n\\n(5) Juipter — Causes death without much trouble or through phelgm.\\n\\n(6) Venus — Venefal diseases or similar ones caused by association with \\n\\n140\\n\\n\\x0cWomen.\\n\\n(7) Saturn — Wind diseases or a dangerous fever like typhoid.\\n\\n(8) Rahu — Leprosy, food poisoning, venomous bites, smallpox  and the \\n\\nlike.\\n\\n(9) Ketu — Unnatural death like suicide, assassination as a result of hatred \\n\\nof enemies or through worms etc.\\n\\n16. The death should be predicted through the evil effect arising from the 8th \\n\\nhouse reckoned from the Lagna or through the evil effect of the sign representing \\n\\nNavamsa occupied by the lord of the 8th house.\\n\\n17-19.   The   diseases   caused   by   the   planets   have   already   been   described \\n\\nearlier. Now are detailed the diseases and troubles caused by the various signs \\n\\nwhich may ultimately become the media of death of the native.\\n\\n(1) Aries — fever due to excess of bile, diseases caused by heat like stroke \\n\\netc., liver or gastric trouble.\\n\\n(2) Taurus — Diseases caused by the imbalance of the three humours bile, \\n\\nphlegm and wind, injury by weapon or fire.\\n\\n(3) Gemini — Catarrah, asthema, or sharp pain such as colic.\\n\\n(4) Cancer — Insanity, windy diseases, loss of appetite etc.\\n\\n(5) Leo — fatal injuries caused by wild animals, fever, boils, enemies.\\n\\n(6) Virgo — Troubles caused by women, veneial diseases, fall from a height.\\n\\n(7) Libra — Brain fever and typhod.\\n\\n(8) Scorpio — Diseases of the spleen, dyspepsia and jaundice.\\n\\n(9) Sagittarius — Injury caused by fall from a tree (or by tree falling of or \\n\\nvarga\\n\\n(10) Capricorn— Stomach-ache, loss or appetite or aberation of mind etc.\\n\\n(11) Aquarius — cough, fever, consumption etc.\\n\\n(12) Pisces — Watery diseases such as Jalodara, drowning, etc.\\n\\n20. If the lord of the 8th house be a malefic and 8th house be a malefic the \\n\\ndeath will be by weapon, fire, tiger or snake.\\n\\nIf two malefics posited in kendras aspect each other, the death will be due to \\n\\n141\\n\\n\\x0cdispleasure of the king, through a weapon, poison or fire.\\n\\n21. If In any nativity, the lord of the 12th house be In a sign or Navamsa of a \\n\\nbenefic or be associated with a benefic or the 12th house be occupied and owned \\n\\nby a benefic, the native will meet with his death without any anguish or suffering. \\n\\nThe death will be painful if the lord of the 12th be posited in the sign or Navamsa \\n\\nof a malefic and be associated with a malefic, or the 12th may\\'be occupied or \\n\\nowned by a malefic.\\n\\n22. If the lord of 12th house be posited in his sign of exaltation, a friendly \\n\\nsign or a varga of a benefic planet or be associated with a benefic planet, the native \\n\\nafter his death goes upwards to heaven. If he is posited in his sigh of debilition, in \\n\\nan inimical sign or in the varga of a malefic planet, he after his death goes to hell. \\n\\nSome interpret this as a result of the native of the sign (of the 12th house) i.e. \\n\\nheaven if the sign is a shirshodaya one and hell if it be a prishtodaya one.\\n\\nNotes - Gemini, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio and Aquarius are Shirshodaya signs. \\n\\nAries, Taurus, Cancer, Sagittarius and Capricorn are Prishtodaya signs. Pisces is an \\n\\nUbhayodaya sign.\\n\\n23. The refuge after death is indicated by (1) the planet or planets posited in \\n\\nthe 12th house, (2) the planet occupying the Navamsa of the 12th house, or the \\n\\npalnet or planets with which the lord of the 12th be connected.\\n\\nIf the Sun or the Moon be such planet the abode of the soul after death will \\n\\nbe Kailash. If Mars be the planet concerned, the native takes birth on the Earth \\n\\nimmediately after death. If Mercury be the planet In question, the next world for \\n\\nthe native will be Vaikuntha. Jupiter takes the native\\'s soul to Brahmaloka, Saturn \\n\\nto the abode of Yama, Rahu to other islands and Ketu to hell.\\n\\n24. It is from the lord of the 9th that all is ascertained about the native\\'s past \\n\\nbirth and all information about his future birth is signified by the lord of the 5th \\n\\nhouse. The particular caste, country and the direction of the person concerned in \\n\\nhis past and future births should be deduced from the lords of the 9th and the 5th \\n\\nhouses respectively.\\n\\n25. If the planets referred to above be in their sign of exaltation, the abode \\n\\n142\\n\\n\\x0cshould   be   declared   as   that   of   Gods   (Devaloka).   If   they   be   in   their   sign   of \\n\\ndebilitation or in an inimical sign, the abodes of past and future birth should be \\n\\ndeclared to be foreign islands. If the above patents be in their own sign, friend\\'s \\n\\nsign or a neutral\\'s sign, such place would be India alone.\\n\\n26. The parts of India covered by the various planets are as under:—\\n\\n(1) The Sun — Mountains and forests.\\n\\n(2) The Moon — Tracts watered by the holy rivers (like Ganga, Yamuna, \\n\\nNarmada, Godavari, etc.).\\n\\n(3) Mars — Keekat Desha now known as Bihar.\\n\\n(4) Mercury — All scared places.\\n\\n(5) Jupfler—Aryavarta bordered in the North by Himalayas, in the South by \\n\\nVindhya, and which extends to oceans in the East and the West\\n\\n(6) Venus —The same places as have been indicated for the Moon.\\n\\n(7)   Saturn   —   Prohibited   places   like   those   inhabited   by   Mlechhas   (non-\\n\\nHindus).\\n\\n27. If the planets referred to in verse 24 (lords of the 9th and the 5th). are \\n\\nposited in a fixed sign or Navamsa which is Prishtodaya and Adhomukha along \\n\\nwith malefics, the past and future briths of the native should be taken as trees, \\n\\nplants and the like. If the lords of the 9th and the 5th houses occupy a Shirshodaya \\n\\nand an Urdhvamukha sign or a moveable sign or navamsa, and be associated with \\n\\nbenefics, the past and future birth will be of an animal kind.\\n\\n28. If the lord of the 9th or the 5th be in the sign of exaltation or own sign \\n\\nthe lord of the Lagna, it would mean that the native\\'s previous or the future birth \\n\\n(as the case may be) will be that of a human being.\\n\\nIf the lord of the 9th occupied a sign neutral to the lord of the Lagna, the \\n\\nnative in the past birth was born as an animal.\\n\\nIf the lord of the 5th be in a sign neutral to the lord of the Lagna. the native \\n\\nin his future birth will be born as an animal.\\n\\nIf the lord of the 9th occupies the sign of debilitation of the lord of the Lagna \\n\\nor in an inimical sign, the native was born as a bird in his previous birth.\\n\\n143\\n\\n\\x0cIf the lord of the 5th be in such a situation, the native will be born as a bird \\n\\nin his next birth.\\n\\nAll   these   may   also   be   declared   with   reference   to   the   appearance   of   the \\n\\ndecanates occupied by the lord of the 9th or the 5th.\\n\\n29. If the lords of the 9th and the 5th be in the same sign, the past birth was \\n\\nin his own country and the future birth will also take place there.\\n\\nIf these two planets be of equal strength, the past and future birth would be \\n\\nin the same caste.\\n\\nThe colour and quality will also be similar to these belonging to the lords of \\n\\nthe 9th and the 5th houses.\\n\\nPrediction regarding all the rest should be similarly made by a reference to \\n\\nwhat has been stated in the Samgnadhyaya.\\n\\nNotes — What has been stated about past and future birth in Venus 21-29 \\n\\nare   of   no   practical   utility   though   they   make   interesting   reading   because   it   is \\n\\nimpossible to verify the correctness of such conclusions.\\n\\n144\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 15\\n\\nAssessment of houses\\n\\n1. The houses occupied and aspected by benefic planets or their own lords, \\n\\nor   planets   owning   auspicious   houses   produce   completely   beneficiary   results \\n\\nprovided that they are not associated with or aspected by malefics. The same will \\n\\nbe the result in the case of malefics if they happen to be lords of such houses. \\n\\nThese good effects will be ensured in the case of all the planets when they are in \\n\\nthe signs of debilitation, combust and in inimical signs.\\n\\n2. It is the view of learned Astrologers that the strength of a house such as \\n\\nthe Lagna should be adequate and the house sufficiently beneficial if the 1st, 2nd, \\n\\n4th, 5th, 7th, 9th and 10th from that house are occupied by auspicious planets or \\n\\nthe lord of the house is free from the occupation by and aspect of malefics. The \\n\\nhouse concerned  should be considered to  deteriorate  in its effects if the  above \\n\\nhouses   are   not   so   occupied   and   aspected.   The   effects   will   be   mixed   if   such \\n\\npositions are influenced by occupation or aspect by both benefics and malefics.\\n\\n3. If the lord of a house be (1) posited in the 8th house, (2) eclipsed by the \\n\\nSun\\'s rays, (3) in his sign of debilitation or (4) in an inimical sign and be devoid of \\n\\nassociation or aspect of benefics, the effects of that house are totally destroyed. \\n\\nSome are of the view that the house in question will also suffer if its lord is in the \\n\\n8th from the Lagna also.\\n\\nIf any benefic being in his sign of debilitation, is in inimical sign or combust \\n\\noccupied any house, unaspected by any oenefic, he will destroy the good effects of \\n\\nthe house owned by him. If a malefic being in his sign of debilitaton, combust or in \\n\\nhis inimical sign unaspected by any benefic will harm the effects of that house. For \\n\\nexample see the horoscope —\\n\\nHere Mars occupies the 5th in his sign of debilitation. Inspite of the aspect \\n\\nof Jupiter on Mars on the 5th house the native lost two sons and himself suffered \\n\\nfrom a serious disease Jalodara.\\n\\n145\\n\\n\\x0cL\\nRahu\\n\\nVenus\\nSat\\n\\nMerc\\nSun \\nMoon\\n\\nMars\\n\\nJup.\\n\\nKetu\\n\\n4.   Malefic   occupying   the   6th,   8th   and   12th   house   with   reference   to   the \\n\\nLagna or other house under examination cause the destruction of that house.\\n\\nNotes—For example we have to assess the effects of the 7th house under \\n\\nexamination. They are not capable of producing good effects of that house.\\n\\nX\\n\\nL\\n\\nX\\n\\nX\\n\\n7th\\n\\nFor example, we have the 7th house under consideration. Suppose Jupiter is \\n\\nposited in the 6th or 8th or 12th from the 7th house. In such a position Jupiter will \\n\\nnot be capable of any strength to the 7th house as from any of these places he will \\n\\nbe unable to aspect the 7th house.\\n\\n146\\n\\n\\x0c5. If the lord of the house under examination is in the 6th, 8th or 12th from \\n\\nthe Lagna, that house is destroyed. The same will be the results if that house is \\n\\noccupied by the Lords of the 6th. 8th or 12th. The house concerned will, however, \\n\\nflourish if it is aspected by a benefic.\\n\\n6. A house suffers annihilation in the following circumstances :—\\n\\n(1) If the house, its lord and karaka be bereft of strength.\\n\\n(2) If the house, its lord and karaka are hemmed in between malefics or be \\n\\nassociated with or aspected by malefics and be devoid of any influence of benefics.\\n\\n(3) If malefics occupy the 4th, 5th, 8th, 9th and 12th houses from that house.\\n\\nThere will be no doubt about the annihilation of the house if any of the two \\n\\nor three conditions\\' mentioned above synchronise.\\n\\nNotes  —  For   example,  in  a  male\\'s  nativity  we  have   to   examine  the  7th \\n\\nhouse. If the 7th house be without any strength, the lord of 7th be posited betwixt \\n\\nmalefics, and malefics occupy the 4th and 8th house from Venus, the first wife of \\n\\nthe native will definitely meet with her death.\\n\\n7. If the lord of the 8th house, the lord of 22nd decanate and lords of 6th, 7th \\n\\nand 8th from a house be without strength, they will cause harm to the house (its \\n\\neffects) in their dasa, and antar dasa.\\n\\nA house will flourish in the dasa of the following planets :—\\n\\n(1) Malefics posited in the 3rd, 6th and 11th from that house.\\n\\n(2) Benefits posited in the 1st, 4th, 5th, 7th, 9th, and 10th from that house.\\n\\n(3) Planets which are friendly to the lord of that hosue.\\n\\nProvided that the planets mentioned above are not devoid of strength.\\n\\nNotes — For example see the following horoscope — Here if we examine \\n\\nthe position of the Lagna we will find that Saturn is an enemy of the Sun (lord of \\n\\nthe Lagna). Therefore there will be physical distress in the dasa and antar dasa of \\n\\nSaturn. Jupiter is a friend of the Sun. Therefore there will be physical felicity in the \\n\\ndasa and antar dasa of Jupiter.\\n\\n147\\n\\n\\x0cSat\\n\\nL\\n\\nJup\\n\\nSun\\n\\n8. The following planets in their dasa and antar dasa cause destruction of the \\n\\nhouse.\\n\\n(1) The lord of the 3rd house from the Lagna\\n\\n(2) The lord of the 3rd house from the Moon\\n\\n(3) The planet occupying the 8th house.\\n\\n(4) The planet which aspects the 8th house.\\n\\n(5) Saturn\\n\\n(6) The lord of the 22nd decanate\\n\\n(7) The lord of the house occupied by Mandi,\\n\\n(8)  The   lord   of   the   sign   and   navamsa   in   which   the   above  7   planets   are \\n\\nposited.\\n\\n(9) Rahu, if he be weak by occupying the 8th or 12th house or by being \\n\\nassociated with or aspected by madefies.\\n\\nNotes — In this verse it has not been made clear which house will become \\n\\nthe victim of destruction but in the previous verse it has been stated that houses \\n\\noccupied by malefics, those surrounded on both sides by malefics, get damaged. \\n\\nThe same principle should apply to this verse.\\n\\n9. Whichever house is occupied by the lord of the Lagna gains in prosperity \\n\\nand well being i.e. it becomes very beneficient and produces very good effects.\\n\\nThe   good   effects   of   only   such   houses   are   enhanced   if   their   lords   are \\n\\n148\\n\\n\\x0cassociated with or aspected by the lord of the Lagna.\\n\\nIf the lord of any house is posited in dusthana (6th, 8th or 12th), the effects \\n\\nwill be reverse. If the planet in the dusthana be weak, the effects will be immensely \\n\\nharmful. If he is strong the damage will be slight.\\n\\n10. In spite of the lord of Lagna being malefic, he will improve the prospects \\n\\nof the house occupied by him. In addition to being the lord of the Lagna, if a planet \\n\\nhappens to own a dusthana (6th, 8th or 12th), the effects of his ownership of Lagna \\n\\nonly will prevail and not that of the other house.\\n\\nFor example, Mars owning the Lagna occupy Leo (Aries being the Lagna) \\n\\nor Pisces (Scorpio being the Lagna) identical with the 5th house and be aspected \\n\\nby a benefic, the person concerned will get sons very soon.\\n\\nL\\n\\nSun \\nMerc\\nVenus\\n\\nRahu\\n\\nSat\\n\\nMoon\\n\\nMars \\nJupt\\nKetu\\n\\nFor example see the horoscope. Here Mars as the lord of Lagna and the 8th \\n\\noccupies the 5th house with Jupiter and Ketu. In spite of Ketu the native is blessed \\n\\nwith sons and daughters.\\n\\n11. Should a planet own two houses, the effects of the house which is the \\n\\nMoolatrikona will predominate while the effects of his own house will be half.\\n\\nNotes — For example in a nativity of Leo Lagna Jupiter will be lord of the \\n\\n5th and the 8th house. The 5th is an auspicious house and the 8th house is evil. As \\n\\nJupiter Moolatrikona (Sagittarius) falls in the 5th house, he will produce the effects \\n\\n149\\n\\n\\x0cof the lord of the 5th predominantly and his effects as the lord of the 8th will be \\n\\nhalf.\\n\\nIn the dasa of such a planet the effects of both the ownerships will come to \\n\\npass (good and bad both). The effects of first sign counted from the Lagna will be \\n\\nexperienced first and the effects of the other sign will be derived later. This is one \\n\\nview. The other view is that a planet posited in an odd sign will produce the effect \\n\\nof that house first while the one that occupies an even sign will have its effect \\n\\nexperiened in the second half of the dasa.\\n\\n12. The   distinction   of   a   house   from  the   Lagna   onwards   during   the   dasa \\n\\nperiod of planets which are very inimical (adhishatru) of the lord of that house or \\n\\nwhich occupy houses where there are no benefic dots in their ashtakavargas.\\n\\nNotes   —   Suppose,   the   maha   dasa   of   Saturn   is   in   operation   and   in   the \\n\\nSaturn\\'s ashtakavarga there are no benefic dots in the 5th house. Thus in the dasa \\n\\nand an tar dasda of Saturn, the 5th house will be damaged and produce evil effects. \\n\\nThe   another   view   in   this   regard:   Suppose   the   Lagna   is   Leo   and   in   the   Sun\\'s \\n\\nashtakavarga there are no benefic dots in Pisces in their dasa and antar dasa will \\n\\ncause physical distress (by damaging the Lagna). According to this view, if in the \\n\\nashtakavarga of the lord of the house under examination, the planet occupying the \\n\\nsign which has no benefic dots, will harm the house concerned in his dasa and \\n\\nantar dasa.\\n\\n13. Even if a planet be posited in his sign of exaltation or a friendly sign or \\n\\nbe enjoying the six kinds of strength (shadabala), he proves in affliction if he is \\n\\nsituated in Bhava-Sandhi (junction of two houses). This must be taken into account \\n\\nwhile predicting the effects of dasas and antar dasas of planets.\\n\\n14.   In   the   case   of   various   houses,   the   planets   occupy   the   exact   degrees \\n\\n(Bhava-Madhya) signified by any particular house, produce the full effects of that \\n\\nhouse. The planets situated in Bhava-Sandhi produce no effects. In the case of \\n\\nplanets   occupying   intermediate   positions,   the   effects   must   be   ascertained   by   a \\n\\nmethod of three processes.\\n\\n15. Ascertainment about his ownself, father, influence, health, vitality and \\n\\n150\\n\\n\\x0cfortune be made from the Sun. The Moon signifies the native\\'s character of heart, \\n\\nunderstanding,   royal   favour,   mother   and   prosperity.   From   Mars   one   should \\n\\nascertain   his   own   courage,   disease,   characteristic,   qualities,   younger   brothers, \\n\\nlands, enemies and paternal blood relations. Mercury is concerned with learning, \\n\\nrelatives in general, discrimination, maternal uncle, friends, and speech.\\n\\n16.   The   native   should   ascertain   about   his   genius,   wealth,   physical \\n\\ndevelopment,   sons   and   knowledge   through   Jupiter.   One   should   seek   the \\n\\njurisdiction of Venus to know about his wife, vehicles, ornaments, love affairs and \\n\\npleasures from spouse. Saturn will furnish information about native\\'s span of life, \\n\\nlivelihood,   the   cause   of   death,   his   adversity   and   his   servants.   Rahu   signifies \\n\\npaternal grand-father and Ketu maternal grand-father.\\n\\n17. The  signification  of   the   kanaka  of  the  houses  commencing   from  the \\n\\nLagna are (1) the Sun, (2) Jupiter, (3) Mars, (4) the Moon and Mercury, (5) Jupiter, \\n\\n(6) Venus, (7) Saturn, (8) the Sun and Jupiter, (9) Jupiter, the Sun, Mercury and \\n\\nSaturn, (10) Jupiter and (11) Saturn.\\n\\n18. If one is to assess the effects of a planet, he should carefully note in \\n\\nwhich of the 12 houses beginning with the Lagna, he is posited and whether it is \\n\\nhis   own   sign,   his   sign   of   exaltation,   his   friend\\'s   sign   or   is   an   inimical   sign. \\n\\nAccording to Satyacharya, the benefics occupying a house promote its growth and \\n\\nthe malefics so posited cause the decay of the house. This is reversed in the case of \\n\\nthe 6th, 8th and 12th houses.\\n\\n19.  If   malefics   occupy   the   6th,   8th   or   12th   house   from   the   Lagna,   they \\n\\nintensify   the   evil   effects   of   those   houses.   Benefics   in   these   houses   cause   the \\n\\ndestruction of these houses. In other words the evil effects arising out of these \\n\\nhouses are destroyed.\\n\\nNotes — Although according to Shri Mantreshwara, the benefics destroy or \\n\\nalleviate the evil effects of the 6th, 8th and 12th houses but being posited there \\n\\nthey themselves get afflicted and harm the houses they own arid do not produce \\n\\nbeneficial results in their dasas and antar dasas.\\n\\n20. In order to assess or judge the effects of a house in the case of nativity, \\n\\n151\\n\\n\\x0cthat house should be treated as the Lagna and the effects of 12 houses reckoned \\n\\nfrom there such as, (first form, 2nd wealth) should be examined and declared.\\n\\nNotes: According to the principle mentioned above if we have to consider \\n\\nabout the wife of the son, we will treat the 5th house as Lagna and the 7th house \\n\\nfrom it, that is the 11th, will signify the wife of the son. Similarly we have to \\n\\nexamine about the wife\\'s wealth, the 7th house should be treated as the Lagna and \\n\\nthe 2nd from the 7th, that is, 8th house will be the house of wealth for the wife on \\n\\nthe same basis about the younger brother\\'s wife we will have to ascertain from the \\n\\n9th house.\\n\\n21. In the  same manner  should the  effects of  the  father,  the  mother, the \\n\\nbrother, the maternal uncle, the son, the husband and the servant be determined by \\n\\ntreating the signs occupied by their respective Karakas. The meaning of this is that \\n\\nif the effects of the father are to be determined, the sign occupied by the Sun \\n\\nshould be treated as the Lagna and the second from that sign all information of the \\n\\nfather\\'s brother and the 3rd about mother\\'s brother and so on. For effects of the \\n\\nmother  the  sign  occupied  by the  Moon,  for the  effects of  the  brother  the  sign \\n\\noccupied by Mercury, for the effects of the son, the sign occupied by Jupiter, for \\n\\nthe effects of wife the sign occupied by Venus, for the effects of servant the sign \\n\\noccupied by Saturn, have to be treated as the Lagna.\\n\\n22 - 24 From the  sign occupied  by  the  Sun  one ought  to  determine  the \\n\\nappearance of the father of the native. The father\\'s financial position and renown \\n\\nshould be ascertained from the 2nd house from the sign occupied by the Sun. His \\n\\ncharacter, brothers etc., should be examined from the 3rd house from that occupied \\n\\nby the Sun. The 4th house reckoned from the Sun will give information about \\n\\nfather\\'s happiness and his mother. The intelligence and tranquility of the father has \\n\\nto be determined from the 5th house, his differences, enemies and disease from the \\n\\n6th house, his love and passion from the 7th house, his longevity and death from \\n\\nthe   8th   house,   his   virtues,   wealth,   father\\'s   father   from   the   9th   house,   his \\n\\nprofessional pursuits from the 10th house, his financial gains from the 11th house \\n\\nand his losses and expenditure from the 12th house from the sign occupied by the \\n\\n152\\n\\n\\x0cSun.\\n\\nIn the same manner, all matters relating to the mother and brother should be \\n\\ndetermined from the signs respectively occupied by the Moon and Mars. From \\n\\nMercury   and   other   planets   the   assessment   of   the   12th   house   from   the   signs \\n\\noccupied by them should be similarly undertaken.\\n\\n25. Thus all details about the father, mother, brother, son etc., of a house \\n\\nshould   be   determined   by   a   reference   to   the   Bhava   concerned,   its   lord   and   its \\n\\nKaraka. When any house, its lord and its Karaka are all strong, the prosperity of \\n\\nthat house is definite.\\n\\n26. But the others say that the Sun in the 9th, the Moon in the 4th, Mars in \\n\\nthe third, Jupiter in the 5th, Venus in the 7th, and Saturn in the 8th will cause \\n\\ndistress to the houses concerned.\\n\\n27. The  lord  of  the   Lagna  produces  effects  pertaining  to   the  house  with \\n\\nwhose lord he is conjoined or the one occupied by him. If the house and its lord be \\n\\nstrong good results may be expected from the house. If they are weak the results \\n\\nwill be adverse.\\n\\n28.   Whatever   houses   contain   longer   number   of   benefic   dots   in   the \\n\\nAshtakavarga of the lord of the Lagna and if the lords of the houses concerned \\n\\nwere strong and be conjoined with the lord of the Lagna, those house will produce \\n\\nbeneficial   result.   If   however,   the   houses   concerned   contain   lesser   number   of \\n\\nbenefic dotes and their lords be devoid of strength and be associated with the lord \\n\\nof the Lagna, those houses will not produce any benefic results. An Assessment of \\n\\nall the houses should be made in this manner.\\n\\n29. If a planet owns two signs one of which falls In an asuspicious position \\n\\nfrom the Lagna and the other in a dusth one (6th, 8th or 12th), and if he occupies \\n\\nthe auspicious sign himself he produces good results of the auspicious houses and \\n\\ndoes not produce any adverse effects of the other signs falling in a dusthana.\\n\\nNotes—For example—Virgo Is the Lagna. Saturn occupies the 5th house \\n\\nIdentical with the sign Capricorn. Although Saturn\\'s other sign Aquarius falls in the \\n\\n6th house (a dusthan), he will produce good results of the 5th house only and the \\n\\n153\\n\\n\\x0cnative will be blessed with children.\\n\\n30. The following are the five recognised connections or relations between \\n\\ntwo planets —\\n\\n(1) When they occupy mutually each other\\'s sign.\\n\\n(2) When they are conjoined.\\n\\n(3) When there is mutual aspect between them.\\n\\n(4) When they are in Kendra position with respect to each other.\\n\\n(5) When they are in Trikona position with reference to each other.\\n\\nThus ends the fifteenth chapter on \"The Effects oJBhavas in Phaladeepika  \\n\\ncomposed by Mantreswara.\\n\\n154\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 16\\n\\nGeneral Effects of the Twelve Houses\\n\\n1. The body of the native is built corresponding to the lord of the Navamsa \\n\\nLagna or the strongest planet in nativity. His complexion will be according to the \\n\\nlord of the house occupied by the Moon. His body and limbs will be in propotion \\n\\nto the rising sign (Lagna) and other signs which are described as forming the head \\n\\nand other portions of Kalapurusha.\\n\\n2. If the lord of the Lagna occupies a kendra or trikona, be uneclipsed and in \\n\\nhis sign of exaltation or own sign and the Lagna be occupied by benefics, while the \\n\\nlord of the 8th be in a house other than kendra,  the native will be long lived, \\n\\nwealthy,   praiseworthy,   equipped   with   virtues,   honoured   by   the   king,   fortunate, \\n\\npossesses beautiful limbs and strong body, fearless, religious minded and having a \\n\\nhappy family.\\n\\n3. If the lord of Lagna be related to an auspicious planet, the native will \\n\\nreside in a good village and amidst noble associations. If the lord of the Lagna be \\n\\nassociated   with   a   planet   vested   with   strength,   the   native   will   live   under   the \\n\\npatronage of a renowned king.\\n\\nWhen the lord of Lagna be posited in his sign of exaltation, the person will \\n\\nbecome a king (but he should not be in 6th, 8th, or 12th).\\n\\nIf the lord of the Lagna be in a moveable sign, the native will contiune to \\n\\nmove from place to place.\\n\\nIf the lord of the lagna be in a fixed sign, the native will live permanently at \\n\\none place.\\n\\nIf the lord of the Lagna be in a dual sign, the native will live for some time \\n\\nat one place while at other times he will move from place to place.\\n\\n4. If at birth, the lord of Lagna be with brilliant rays, the native becomes \\n\\nfamous. If the lord of Lagna occupies an auspicious position, the native will be \\n\\nhappy and prosperous. If, however, the lord of Lagna be placed in a dusthana, be in \\n\\nhis sign of debilitation or in the sign of a malefic, the native will be miserable and \\n\\n155\\n\\n\\x0clive in an undesirable place.\\n\\nIf   the   lord   of   Lagna   be   equipped   with   strentgth   and   be   posited   in   an \\n\\nauspicious house, the native will be happy, valiant, prosperous and will come to \\n\\npower and prominence.\\n\\nIf the lord of the Lagna be devoid of strength, the native will be constantly \\n\\novercome by calamities, be unhappy and will lead a sickly life.\\n\\n5. If the lord of the 2nd house be posited in the Lagna while the 2nd house \\n\\nbe occupied by benefics, the native will be equipped with the best of qualities, \\n\\nwealth, with a handsome face and farsighted and will have a prosperous family.\\n\\nIf the lord of the 2nd be connectd with or related to the Sun, the native will \\n\\nbe wealthy and utilise his wealth for the good of the whole humanity.\\n\\nIf the lord of the 2nd be related to Saturn, the person concerned will be \\n\\nbereft of learning or it will be of a very low order.\\n\\n6. If the lord of the 2nd be connected with Jupiter, the native will be well \\n\\nversed   in   the   Vedas   and   the   sacred   scriptures.   If   Mercury   be   the   Planet   so \\n\\nassociated, the native will specialise in economics and allied subjects, with Venus \\n\\nas the associate the native will be expert In amorous topics. When the lord of the \\n\\n2nd is connected with Moon, the person concerned will be clever in some kinds of \\n\\narts. When connected with Mars, the native will be adapt in tasks involving cruelty \\n\\nand he will be a back-biter. If the planet asociated with the lord of the 2nd be Rahu, \\n\\nthe native will be stammering. If he be Ketu, the person concerned will stammer \\n\\nand speak falsehood.\\n\\nIf malefics occupy  the  2nd house,  the  native  will  be a fool  and without \\n\\nwealth.\\n\\n7. If the lord of the 3rd and the lord of the Lagna be connected with each \\n\\nother   by   mutual   exchange   of   places,   the   native   will   be   capable   of   performing \\n\\ndaring acts, patient, volorous and will be affectionate towards his brothers.\\n\\n8. If the lord of the 3rd house be equipped with strength, be conjoined with a \\n\\nbenefic and the karaka of the 3rd house be also strong and posited in a benefic \\n\\nhouse, the prosperity of brothers is assured. If, however, the lord of the 3rd and its \\n\\n156\\n\\n\\x0ckaraka be weak and be posited in a dusthana, the result will be destruction of \\n\\nbrothers.\\n\\n9. If the lord of the 3rd house and its karaka (Mars) be posited in odd signs \\n\\nand be aspected by Jupiter the Sun and Mars and the 3rd house also falling in an \\n\\nodd sign, the native will have as many brothers as revealed by the navamsa of both \\n\\nthe karaka and the lord of the 3rd house.\\n\\n10. Hie mother of the native dies soon after his birth if in any nativity, the \\n\\nlord   of   the   4th   and   the   Moon   be   posited   in   dusthana   unassociated   with   and \\n\\nunaspected by any benefics, or be hemmed in between malefics and be associated \\n\\nwith or aspected by malefics. Should, however, the above two planets be strong, be \\n\\nassociated with or aspected by benefics and a benefic occupies the 4th house, the \\n\\nmother\\'s   happiness   is   assured.   Mother   will   also   live   happily   with   benefics   be \\n\\nposited in auspicious houses reckoned from the Moon.\\n\\n11. The native will certainly perform the funeral rites of his mother if —\\n\\n(1) The lord of the 4th be in the Lagna and the lord of Lagna be in the 4th.\\n\\n(2) The Moon be aspected by the lord of either the lord of the Lagna or the \\n\\nlord of the 4th house.\\n\\nThe native will be unable to perform the funeral rites of his mother if the \\n\\nplanetary dispositions be as under —\\n\\n(i) If the lord of the Lagna and the lord of the 4th be in the 6th and the 8th \\n\\nwith reference to each other or be in each other\\'s sign of depression or inimical \\n\\nsign.\\n\\n(ii) They may not be connected with each other in any way.\\n\\n12. Just as the fourth house and its karate the Moon have been assessed for \\n\\nJudging the effects of the fourth house, assessment should be made in the same \\n\\nmanner   in   respect   of   father,   brother,   sons   etc.,   by   taking   into   account   the \\n\\ncircumstances of the house concerned, its karaka planets occupying the house, the \\n\\nlord of the house, connection of the planets with the Lagna and the lord of the \\n\\nLagna.\\n\\nNotes — If the Lagna and the lord of the Lagna be strong, there will be good \\n\\n157\\n\\n\\x0crelations between the 5th house, lord of the 5th house and Jupiter, there will be \\n\\nmutual affection between the native and his sons and the sons will be happy and \\n\\nprosperous. If the lord of the Lagna and the lord of the 5th be mutual enemies and \\n\\nbe   6th   and   8th   to   each   other   and   be   in   each   other\\'s   inimical   sign   or   sign   of \\n\\ndebilitation, the effects will be quite the opposite.\\n\\n13. If the lord of the 4th or Venus be well placed in the Lagna or the 4th \\n\\nhouse   (and   be   uneclipsed   in   signs   of   their   debilitation),   the   native   enjoys   the \\n\\nhonour  of riding  a  palanquin,  he becomes  4 lord  or  a king  and acquires  gold, \\n\\nvaluable ornaments, conch, silk, cow, items of luxuries, elephants, horses, etc.\\n\\n14. If the lord of the 4th house be In dusthana (6th, 8th or 12th) or associated \\n\\nwith the Sun and Mars or the Sun and Mars be in the 4th house, the house in which \\n\\nthe native was born will be burnt. If the lord of 4th be in the 4th with Rahu and \\n\\nSaturn, the house will be old and dilapidated. If there will be an inimical planet in \\n\\nthe   4th,   native\\'s   belongings   such   as   cow   s,   lands   vehicles,   etc.,   will   be \\n\\nmisappropriated by others.\\n\\n15. If the 5th house be in a benefic sign and in the navamsa of a benefic, the \\n\\nnative will be intelligent and open hearted. The same will be the result if the lord of \\n\\n5th be posited in an auspicious house and has attained Vaisheishikamsa.\\n\\n16. (1) Malefics in the 6th, (2) the lord of the Lagna in association With or \\n\\naspected by a strong lord of the 6th. (3) the lord of the Lagna posited in the 6th, (4) \\n\\nthe   lord   of   the   6th   posited   in   a   kendra   house   and   (5)   the   lord   of   the   6th   in \\n\\nconjunction   with   or   aspected   by   malefics,   will   cause   the   native   immense   and \\n\\nconstant harrassment for which there will be no remedies.\\n\\n17. If the lord of the Lagna be much stronger than the lord of the 6th, be in \\n\\nthe sign or navamsa of a benefic and be aspected by benefics, and a strong lord of \\n\\n4th occupies a kendra or trikona, the native will be hale and healthy, will not suffer \\n\\nfrom any disease and will be fortunate.\\n\\n18. If the lord of the 6th be in the 6th in his sign of depression, in an inimical \\n\\nsign and eclipsed by Sun\\'s rays, and the lord of the Lagna be stronger than the lord \\n\\nof the 6th with the Sun in the 9th, the native destroys his enemies.\\n\\n158\\n\\n\\x0cNotes — There is another version of this verse according to which, it will \\n\\nread as (...). If this version is adopted it will mean that instead of Sun being in the \\n\\n9th, there would be benefic in the 6th.\\n\\nWe would also like to mention that the lord of the 6th in 6th can never be in \\n\\na sign of depression or an inimical sign. He will always in his own sign. He can, \\n\\nhowever, be eclipsed by Sun\\'s rays.\\n\\n19. (1) The house, the lord of which is associated with the lord of the 6th. (2) \\n\\nthe house occupied by the lord of the 6th. and (3) the house, the lord of which is \\n\\nposited in the 6th. these will always be inimical to the native.\\n\\nNotes — For example if the lord of 6th is posited in the 5th, the lord of the \\n\\n5th is in the 6th or the lords of the 5th and 6th be together in any house, his son \\n\\nwill be inimical towards the native.\\n\\n20. If the 7th house be connected with benefics and the lord of the 7th be \\n\\nwell equipped with strength, the wife of the native will be devoted to her husband, \\n\\nwill be full of virtues and good qualities and will be blessed with sons (children).\\n\\n21. If in any nativity the lord of the 8th house be posited in any house other \\n\\nthan a kendra and the lord of the 8th be weaker than the lord of the Lagna, the \\n\\nnative will be longlived and will be free from all kinds of anxieties, obstacles and \\n\\nmiseries.\\n\\n22. If the Sun or Mars be in the 9th and the lord of the 9th be in a dusthana \\n\\n(6th, 8th or 12th) or be hemmed in between malefics, the father dies soon after the \\n\\nnative\\'s birth.\\n\\nNotes — If the death does not take place immediately, if will take place in \\n\\nthe dasa antar dasa of the Sun or Mars.\\n\\n23. If the Sun in the case of day birth and Saturn in the event of a night birth, \\n\\nbe posited in an auspicious position and be connected with the benefics, and the \\n\\nlord of the 9th be strong, the father of the native will be longlived.\\n\\n24. If the Sun and the Moon be in trine with Saturn and Mars, the native at \\n\\nbirth will be abandoned by his parents but if the Sun and the Moon be graced by \\n\\nthe aspect of Jupiter, the native will be longlived and happy.\\n\\n159\\n\\n\\x0c25. If Saturn being lord of the 9th, be in a moveable sign unaspected by \\n\\nbenefics and the Sun be in a dusthana, the native (the child born) is brought up by a \\n\\nperson other than his father.\\n\\n26. If the 9th house being in a moveable sign is associated with or aspected \\n\\nby Saturn and if the lord of the 12th house be strong, the child born is sure to be \\n\\nadopted by another.\\n\\n27. If the 10th house be conjoined with a benefic and the lord of 10th with \\n\\nfull strength be posited in a kendra or trikora identical with his own sign or his sign \\n\\nof exaltation, or if the lord of the Lagna equipped with strength be posited in the \\n\\n10th,   the   native   will   be   fortunate   like   a   king,   will   be   longlived   and   widely \\n\\nrenowned and will perform virtuous actions.\\n\\n28. If the 10th house is occupied by the Sun and Mars, the native will be a \\n\\nvery influential and mighty personage. If at the same time lord of the 10th be \\n\\nposited   in   an   auspicious   position,   the   person   concerned   will   be   capable   of \\n\\naccomplishing great undertakings with much valour and heroism. If the 10th house \\n\\nbe occupied by benefics he will undertake commendable ventures for the good of \\n\\nthe people. But the native will indulge in nefarious activities if the 10th is occupied \\n\\nby Saturn, Rahu or Ketu.\\n\\n29. Predict the acquisition or gain of articles connected with the (1) house \\n\\nthe lord of which is conjoined with the lord of the 11th, (2) the house in which the \\n\\nlord of the 11th be posited and (3) the houses lords of which occupy the 11th.\\n\\nNotes — For example the lord of the 11th is posited in the 5th, or the Jord of \\n\\nthe   5th   occupies   the   11th,   or   the   lords   of   the   5th   and   the   11th   are   conjoined \\n\\ntogether, with  such disposition of the  lords of the 5th  and 11th,  the prediction \\n\\nshould be that there will be gain or acquisition of learning and children and profit \\n\\nin speculation because these are all signified by the 5th house.\\n\\n30. Predict loss of the articles or significations connected with the (1) house \\n\\nthe lord of which occupies the 12th house and (2) the house in which the lord of \\n\\nthe 12th be posited.\\n\\nNotes — For example the lord of the 4th occupies the 12th. This will cause \\n\\n160\\n\\n\\x0closs of vehicles and lands etc. If the 12th lord occupies the 5th, there may be loss \\n\\nof children, or loss in speculation etc.\\n\\nFructification of the houses\\n\\n31. The acquisition or success of a house should be declared in the following \\n\\nsituations :—\\n\\n(1) When the lord of the Lagna passes in transit in trikona through the sign \\n\\nor navamsa occupied by the lord of the house.\\n\\n(2) When the lord of the Lagna passes through that house in transit.\\n\\n(3) When the lord of the house transits in the sign which is trikona to the \\n\\nsign or navamsa occupied by the lord of the Lagna.\\n\\n(4) When in course of transit the lord of the Lagna and the lord of the house \\n\\nget conjoined or aspect each other.\\n\\n(5) When the karaka of the house in course of his transit gets conjoined with \\n\\nthe lord of the Lagna or the lord of the sign occupied by the Moon.\\n\\nSimilar  assessment  should be made from the  sign in which the  Moon is \\n\\nposited (Chandra lagna).\\n\\n32. Note the position of the sign or navamsa occupied by the lord of the \\n\\nhouse under consideration. When Jupiter, in course of his transit, is in trikona to \\n\\nthat sign and navamsa, the derivation of the good effects of the house may be \\n\\nexpected.\\n\\n33. When in the course of their transit the lord of the Lagna and the 6th \\n\\nhouse get into conjunction, the native will overcome his enemies, if the lord of the \\n\\n6th house is weaker than the lord of the lagna. If the lord of the 6th house is \\n\\nstronger than the lord of the Lagna, quite opposite will be the results.\\n\\n34. If there be natural or temporal enimity between the lord of the lagna and \\n\\nthe lord of a house or they be posited 6th and 8th to each other, enimity or jealousy \\n\\nwill arise to the native with the person signified by that house, whenever the lord \\n\\nof the lagna and the house concerned get conjoined in the course of their transits. \\n\\nBut if there is natural and temporal friendship between the lord of the lagna and the \\n\\nlord of the house in.question, there will be new friendships whenever the two lords \\n\\n161\\n\\n\\x0cconjoin in the course of their transits.\\n\\nNotes — See the following horoscope as our example in this horoscope the \\n\\nlord of the Lagna is the Sun and the lord of the 6th is Saturn. Both are natural and \\n\\ntemporal enemies and or in the 6th and 8th positions with respect to each other. \\n\\nWhenever the Sun and Saturn conjoin in course of their transits, the native will \\n\\nsuffer on account of rivalries and enemities. Also note that the Sun is the lord of \\n\\nthe lagna and Jupiter is the lord of the 5th. Both are natural and temporal friends. \\n\\nGood effects of 5th house should be derived when the Sun and Jupiter conjoin in \\n\\ncourse of their transits.\\n\\nMOON\\n\\nRAHU \\nSAT\\n\\nL\\n\\nMERC\\n\\nSUN \\nMARS \\nVEN\\n\\nJUP\\n\\n35. The success of the house under examination may be declared when the \\n\\nlord of the lagna gets into conjunction with the lord of that house in course of their \\n\\ntransits provided that the lord of the house concerned is strong, otherwise the result \\n\\nwill be different.\\n\\nSimilar assessment should be made with reference to the sign in which the \\n\\nMoon Is posited (Chandra lagna).\\n\\nThus ends the 16th Adhyaya on \"the general effect of the 12 Bhavas\" in the \\n\\nwork Phaladeeplka composed by Mantreswara.\\n\\n162\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 17\\n\\nExit from the world\\n\\n1. When Saturn in course of his transit passes through the sign and navamsa \\n\\nof the lord of 8th or the 12th with respect of any house, that house would be treated \\n\\nas having been destroyed. The same will happen when Saturn transits houses that \\n\\nare triangular to these two houses.\\n\\nSaturn as the determinator of death\\n\\n2. Find out the sign and navamsa occupied by (1) the lord of the 8th house, \\n\\n(2) Gulika, (3) Saturn or (4) the lord of the 22nd decanate (counted from that of the \\n\\nlagna). When in the course of his transit Saturn passes that sign or navamsa or its \\n\\ntrikona position, death may take place of the native.\\n\\n3.-4. The death of the native may take place when Jupiter in course of transit \\n\\npasses through the sign or navamsa occupied by any of the following three planets \\n\\nor their triangular position\\n\\n(1) The lord of the decanate that is rising\\n\\n(2) The lord of the 8th house\\n\\n(3) The lord of the 22nd decanate\\n\\n(4) Find out the position of\\n\\n(i) Dwadasamsa sign of the Sun,\\n\\n(ii) The navamsa of the lord of the 8th house\\n\\n(iii) The .navamsa of the lord of the Lagna.\\n\\nJupiter or the Sun, when in course of his transit, passes through any of these \\n\\nsigns or those triangular to them, the death of the native may take place.\\n\\nNotes — In the above verses it has been indicated that the death may take \\n\\nplace  when Saturn, Jupiter  and the Sun  transit  certain  positions. This does not \\n\\nmean that death will definitely take place at the time specified as Saturn makes a \\n\\nfull round of the Zodiac in 30 years, Jupiter in 12 years and the Sun in one year. \\n\\nThe intention of indicating the eifects of these transits is that if the time of death \\n\\nmay   have   to   be   determined   during   the   dasa   of   a   maraka   planet,   these   transits \\n\\n163\\n\\n\\x0cshould be taken into account.\\n\\n5. The death of the native takes place when the Moon in course of his transit \\n\\npasses the sign occupied by the lord of the 8th or the Sun or a sign triangular to \\n\\nthem.  All   that   has   been   stated   in   the   above   verses   should   be   examined   with \\n\\nreference to the Lagna as well as the sign occupied by the Moon (Chandra Lagna).\\n\\n6. Subtract the longitude of Yamakantaka from the longitude of the lord of \\n\\nthe Lagna, subtract the longitude of Saturn from that of the Moon. The death of the \\n\\nnative will take place when Jupiter in the course of his transit passes through the \\n\\nsign   and   its   navamsa   indicated   by   each   of   these   differences   or   their   trikona \\n\\nposition.\\n\\nSubtract the longitude of Mars from that of Rahu. When Jupiter in the course \\n\\nof   his   transit   passes   through   the   navamsa   or   the   sign   thus   indicate   by   the \\n\\ndifference, the death of the brother may take place.\\n\\n7.   Subtract   the   longitude   of   the   Sun   from   that   of   the  Yamakantaka,   the \\n\\nremainder may be marked as (A). When Jupiter in the course of his transit passes \\n\\nthrough the sign and navamsa indicated by (A) and the trikona position from it, the \\n\\ndeath of the native\\'s father may take place.\\n\\nSubtract   the   longitude   of   Mandi   or   Gulika   from   the   longitude   of   the \\n\\nYamakantaka. Mark the difference as (A). When Jupiter in the course of his transit \\n\\npasses   the   sign   or   navamsa   indication   or   its   trikona   position,   the   death   of   the \\n\\nnative\\'s father may take place.\\n\\nSubtract the longitude of the Moon from that of the Sun and Mark it (B). \\n\\nWhen Saturn in the course of his transit passes through the sign and or navamsa \\n\\nindicated by (B) or the trikona position from them, the death of the native\\'s mother \\n\\nmay take place.\\n\\nSubtract the longitude of Mandi from the longitude of the Moon and mark it \\n\\n(C). When Saturn in the course of his tranist passes through the sign or navamsa \\n\\nindicated   by   (C)   and   the   trikona   position   from   them,   the   death   of   the   native\\'s \\n\\nmother may take place.\\n\\n8. Subtract the longitude of the lord of the nakshatra fifth from the Janma \\n\\n164\\n\\n\\x0cnakshatra,   the   longitude   of   the  Yamakantaka.   When   Jupiter   passes   through   in \\n\\ncourse of his transit, the sign or navamsa indicated by the difference or the trikona \\n\\nposition from them, the death of the native\\'s son may take place.\\n\\nDetermination of Native\\'s Death\\n\\n9. Add the longitudes of the Lagna, the Sun and Mandi. Find out the location \\n\\nof the lord of the sign indicated by the result. When Jupiter in the course of his \\n\\ntransit passes through the sign so occupied by such lord or the trikona position \\n\\nfrom it, the death of the native may take place.\\n\\n10. Subtract the longitude of Saturn from that of Mars. When Saturn in the \\n\\ncourse of his transit passes through the sign or navamsa indicated by the difference \\n\\nor the trikona position from them, the death of the native may take place.\\n\\nAdd   the   longitudes   of   the   five   upagrahas   reckoned   from   Dhuma.  When \\n\\nSaturn in the course of his transit passes through the particular drekkana or the sign \\n\\nindicated by the aggregate, the death of the native may take place.\\n\\n11. Add the longitudes of the Lagna and Mandi. The rasi and its navamsa \\n\\nindicated by the aggregate will give clue to the particular month and the portion \\n\\nthereof in a year in which the death of the native may be expected to happen (i.e. \\n\\nWhen the Sun arrives at this particular sign and the particular navamsa thereof, the \\n\\nperson will die).\\n\\nAdd the longitude of Mandi and the Moon. The Moon will be posited in the \\n\\nsign indicated by the aggregate at the time of death.\\n\\nAdd the longitudes of the Lagna, Mandi and the Moon. The sign of the \\n\\nLagna at the time of death, will be indicated by the sum total of the above three \\n\\nlongitudes.\\n\\n12. Find out the navamsa, the Dwadasmsa and drekkana indicated by the \\n\\nlongitude of Mandi. The death of the native takes places when —\\n\\n(1) Jupiter in course of his transit passes through the above navamsa.\\n\\n(2) Saturn in course of the transit passes through the above dwadasamsa.\\n\\n(3) The Sun in course of his transit passes through the above drekkana and \\n\\nthe Trikona position from it, and the Lagna is the sign occupied by the lord of the \\n\\n165\\n\\n\\x0csign denoted by the aggregate of the longitudes of the Lagna (at birth), the Moon \\n\\nand Mandi.\\n\\n13. Multiply separately the longitudes of Mandi and Saturn by 9. Add both \\n\\nthe results. When Saturn in course of his transit arrives at the Sign or navamsa \\n\\nindicated by the aggregate, the death of the native may take place.\\n\\n14. Subtract the longitude of Yamakantaka from the Longitude of the Lagna. \\n\\nThe death of the native will definitely take place when Jupiter in course of his \\n\\ntransit arrives at the sign or navamsa indicated by the difference.\\n\\n15. Add the longitudes of the lord of the 6th, 8th and 12th. The death of the \\n\\nnative takes place when Saturn in course of his transit passes through the sign or \\n\\nnavamsa indicated by the aggregate or in trikona position to them.\\n\\n16. Find out the Drekkana of the Lagna and where the lord of that Drekkana \\n\\nis posited. There will be danger to the life of the native when Jupiter in course of \\n\\nhis trainsit passes through this position or its trikona.\\n\\nWhen Saturn transits the house owned by the lord of the Drekkana of the 8th \\n\\nhouse or its Trikona, the death of the native may take place.\\n\\n17. Find the weakness of the following sets of planets—\\n\\n(1) The lord of the 8th house from the Lagna and the lord of the 8th house \\n\\nfrom the Moon.\\n\\n(2) The lords of the 22nd decanate from the Lagna and the Moon.\\n\\n(3) The Moon and Mandi.\\n\\nWhen Saturn in the course of his transit passes through the navamsa of the \\n\\nweakest amongst them or his trikona, the death of the native may take place.\\n\\n18. See the navamsa in which the lord of the Lagna is posited. Mark it as \\n\\n(A). Similarly mark the sign of the lord of 8th house as (B). When Saturn in the \\n\\ncourse of his transit passes through the sign as far away from (B) as is (A) from \\n\\nAries, the  death  of the  native  may  take  place.  This  is the  view  of  the  learned \\n\\nAstrologers who are also versed in many Shastras.\\n\\n19. Death may also take place when the Moon in the course of her transit \\n\\npasses through the house occupied by the lord of 22nd decanate counted from that \\n\\n166\\n\\n\\x0cof the Moon at the time of birth or its trikona position or through the Lagna sign, \\n\\nthe 8th house or the 12th house.\\n\\n20. The death of the native may take place when\\n\\n(1) The Sun in the course of his transit passes through the sign occupied by \\n\\nthe lord of the 8th house.\\n\\n(2) The Moon in the course of her transit passes through thesign occupied by \\n\\nthe Sun or through the nakshatra occupied by the lord of the 8th house.\\n\\n21. If it is a case of night birth find out in which sign Gulika is posited. The \\n\\ndeath of the native takes place when Saturn in the course of his transit passes \\n\\nthrough the trikona position of that sign. In the case of day birth the death of the \\n\\nnative may take place when Saturn in the course of his transit passes through the \\n\\nsign 7th to that occupied by Gulika.\\n\\n22. Add the longitudes of Jupiter and Rahu. The native will face danger of \\n\\ndeath when Jupiter in the course of his transit passes through the sign denoted by \\n\\nthe sum of the two longitudes or its trikona position.\\n\\n23. The death of the native takes place when Saturn in the course of his \\n\\ntransit passes through the house occupied by the lord of the decanate of the 8th \\n\\nhouse.\\n\\nThe death of the native may also take place when Saturn in the course of his \\n\\ntransit  passes through the navamsa sign occupied by the lord of the 8th house \\n\\nreckoned from the Lagna.\\n\\n24. There is likelihood of the death of the native when Saturn in the course \\n\\nof his transit passes through the sign and navamsa occupied by him at birth or its \\n\\ntrines.\\n\\nThe   same   may   happen   when   Saturn   in   the   course   of   his   transit   passes \\n\\nthrough the sign or navamsa occupied by the lord of sign in which the Moon is \\n\\nposited or its trines.\\n\\nDeath of the native may also take place when Saturn in the course of his \\n\\ntransit passes through the sign or navamsa occupied by the lord of the 6th from the \\n\\nLagna and its trines.\\n\\n167\\n\\n\\x0c25. In the case of a night birth death of the native may happen when Saturn \\n\\nin the course of his transit passes through the sign or navamsa occupied by the \\n\\nMoon or the Mandi.\\n\\nIn the case of a day birth, the death may take  place when Saturn in the \\n\\ncourse of his transit passes through the sign occupied by the Sun or through the \\n\\n5th, 7th, or 9th from the position occupied by the Sun.\\n\\n26, Find out how far Mandi is removed from the lord of the 8th house. When \\n\\nSaturn in the course of his transit arrives at the sign so far removed from Mandi, \\n\\ndeath may take place: So say the revered preceptors.\\n\\n27. The death will definitely take place when the Sun in the course of his \\n\\ntransit passes through the 6th, 7th or 12th house reckoned from Venus: this is the \\n\\nverdict of the preceptors.\\n\\n28. The death may take place when Saturn, Jupiter Sun and the Moon in \\n\\ncourse of their transits pass through (1) the house occupied by the lord of the 8th, \\n\\n(2) the house occupied by the lord of the 12th, (3) the house occupied by the lord \\n\\nof the 6th, (4) the house occupied by the 8th house decanate i.e. the 22nd decanate \\n\\nand (5) the house occupied by Mandi.\\n\\nThe same may happen when these in the course of their transits pass through \\n\\nthe navamsas of the five planets state above or their trikona positions.\\n\\nThus   ends   the   seventeenth   chapter   on   \"Exit   from   the   World\"   in  \\n\\nPhaladeepika\" composed by Mantreswara.\\n\\n168\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 18\\n\\nAspects of conjunction of two planets\\n\\n1. If at the birth of a person the Sun be in conjunction with the Moon, he will \\n\\nbe skilled in machine and stone work. If the Sun be in conjunction with Mars, he \\n\\nwill be sinful. If the Sun be associated with Mercury, the native will be talented, \\n\\nintelligent,  renowned   and happy.  If  the  Sun   be in   conjunction  with   Jupiter  the \\n\\nperson concerned will be cruel and will intent on helping others. If the Sun and \\n\\nVenus be together at birth, the native will earn through dancing, singing, by acting \\n\\nin theatre or Cinema or by the use of weapons. If the Sun be in conjunction with \\n\\nSaturn; the native will be skillful in the working of metals or in various sorts of \\n\\npottery.\\n\\n2. If the Moon be in conjunction with Mars, the person will be a dealer in \\n\\nhammer,   ploughs   and   similar   rough   instruments,   and   earthen   pots.   He   will   be \\n\\ndisobedient to his mother. If the Moon be associated with Mercury, the person \\n\\nconcerned   will   be   soft   spoken,   will   be   clever   in   interpretation   (or   clever   in \\n\\nfinancial   matters).   He   will   be   fortunate   and   famous.   When   the   Moon   be   in \\n\\nconjunction with Jupiter, the person concerned will be victorious over enemies and \\n\\nfickle minded. He will be head of his family and very wealthy. If the Moon and \\n\\nVenus be together, the person concerned will specialise in weaving, tailoring and \\n\\ndying of clothes. If the Moon be in conjunction with Saturn, the person born will \\n\\nbe the son of a woman (widow) who remarried.\\n\\n3. If at birth Mars and Mercury be associated with each other, the person \\n\\nconcerned, will be a dealer in herbs, plants, books, oil and drugs. He will be clever \\n\\nin boxing. If Mars and Jupiter be together he will be administrator of a city or \\n\\ntown, or a king or a rich Brahmin. If Mars be with Venus, the person born will be \\n\\nowner of court, a wrestler, one who has affairs with other people\\'s wives, gambler, \\n\\nand   clever.   When   Mars   and   Saturn   be   together   the   native   will   be   unhappy, \\n\\ncondemned by all and does not stick to his word.\\n\\n4.   When   Mercury   be   in   conjunction   with   Jupiter   at   birth,   the   person \\n\\n169\\n\\n\\x0cconcerned will be an actor, fond of singing and well versed in dancing. When \\n\\nMercury be associated with Venus, the native will be eloquent in speech, owner of \\n\\nlands and will become head of assembly. If Mercury be conjoined with Saturn, the \\n\\nperson will be an expert cheat, and addicted to licentious pleasures.\\n\\nIf Jupiter be in conjunction with Venus the person born will be learned, will \\n\\npossess wealth and wife and will be equipped with noble qualities. If Jupiter be \\n\\nassociated with Saturn at birth, the person concerned will be a barber, a potter or a \\n\\ncook.\\n\\n5. If Venus and Saturn be together, the native will be short sighted. Such a \\n\\nperson earns wealth and becomes prosperous through a young woman. He will be \\n\\nwell versed in painting and writing.\\n\\nIf more than two planets get Into conjunction in a house, the effects should \\n\\nbe declared by taking into account the effects described for the various pairs of \\n\\nplanets constituting the Yoga.\\n\\nEffects of aspects on the Moon\\n\\n6.

If   at   birth   the   Moon   be   occupying   the   navamsa   of   Mercury   and   be \\n\\naspected   by   the   Sun,   Mars,   Mercury,   Jupiter,   Venus   and   Saturn,   the   person \\n\\nconcerned   will   respectivery   become   (1)   an   actor,   (2)   a   thief,   (3)   a   poet   (4)   a \\n\\nminister, (5) one versed in singing and (6) skilled in arts.\\n\\nIf the Moon at birth he posited in his own navamsa and be aspected by the \\n\\nSun,   Mars,   Mercury,   Jupiter,   Venus   and   Saturn,   the   person   concerned   will \\n\\nrespectivery become (1) short statured, (2) greedy (3) one who practises penance, \\n\\n(4) one who occupies a high position (5) one who works as a subordinate to a \\n\\nwoman, (6) one who keeps himself engaged in his work.\\n\\n14. If at birth the Moon occupies the navamsa of the Sun and be aspected by \\n\\nthe Sun, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus and Saturn, the person will respectivery \\n\\nbecome (1) angry, (2) a favourite of the king, (3) owner of a treasure (wealthy), (4) \\n\\na holder of a high position, (5) childless, (6) violent and cruel.\\n\\nIf at birth, the Moon occupies the navamsa of Jupiter and be aspected by the \\n\\nSun, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus and Saturn the person will respectively become \\n\\n(1) renowned for his strength and power.

What has been declared in verses 12-15 as effects of navamsa due to the \\n\\nMoon   being   posited   in   the   navamsas   of   the   Sun   and   other   planets,   should   be \\n\\nunderstood to be the effects derived from the navamsa division. The effects that \\n\\nhave   been   mentioned   as   resulting   from   the   Moon   in   the   several   signs   being \\n\\naspected by the different planets should be applicable in the case of Dwadasamsa \\n\\nalso.\\n\\n17.   The   good   effects   declared   above   will   be   full   or   medium   or   little \\n\\naccording as the Moon occupies a Vargottama position, his own navamsa or the \\n\\nnavamsa of another planet. In the case of bad effects it will be the reverse. Again, if \\n\\nthe lord of navamsa occupied by the Moon be strong, the effects described for the \\n\\nMoon in several signs and aspected by the several planets will be multiplied and \\n\\nonly their effects due to the Moon occupying the particular navamsa subject to the \\n\\nparticular planetary aspect will come to pass.\\n\\nThus   ends   the   eighteenth   chapter   on   \"Conjunction   of   two   Planets\"   in  \\n\\nPhaladeepika composed by Mantreswara.\\n\\n173\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 19\\n\\nDasas and their effects\\n\\n1. The nine planets who were worshipped in many ways with devotion for a \\n\\nlong   time   by   sage   Parasara,   having   been   pleased   bestowed   upon   him   the \\n\\nknowledge of accurately determining their effects (on births in this world). Being \\n\\nconvinced after many tests that they are unfailing, I take out the essence from the \\n\\nastrological scripts containing his famous sayings and set forth the famous Maha \\n\\nDasa.\\n\\n2. Count the stars from Krittika in groups of nine. The planets presiding over \\n\\nthe dasas belonging to the nine nakshatras composing each group are respectively \\n\\nthe Sun, the Moon, Mars, Rahu, Jupiter, Saturn, Mercury, Ketu and Venus and the \\n\\nspan of their dasa periods are respectively 6, 10, 7, 18, 16, 19, 17, 7 and 20 year.\\n\\nNotes — The following table clarifies what has been mentioned above:—\\n\\nNakshatra  Nakshatra  Nakshatra  Lord of \\n\\nDasa period\\n\\nNakshatra \\n\\nSravan \\nMoon \\nDhanista  Mars \\nSatabhlsha  Rahu \\nP.

Now is described the method  of finding the  remainder of the  dasa of \\n\\nplanet at the time of birth. Find out the nakshatra in which the Moon is posited at \\n\\nbirth   and   for   how   many   ghatikas   it   will   remain   after   birth   in   that   nakshatra. \\n\\nMultiply those ghatikas by the total period of the dasa and divide it by 60. The \\n\\nquotient will represent the period in years still to elapse. Any remainder remaining \\n\\nmay be converted into months by multiplying by 30 and dividing by 60 and so on.\\n\\nNotes — This is clarified below by an example. Suppose at the time of birth \\n\\n174\\n\\n\\x0c20 ghatikas were still to elapse in Punarvasu nakshatra. Birth in Punarvasu means \\n\\nthat the dasa in operation would be of Jupiter. How much of Jupiter remains at the \\n\\ntime of birth.\\n\\n20*16/60 = 16/3 = 5 years 4 months.\\n\\nThere is some difference of opinion between the author of Phala deepika and \\n\\nother   authorities   about   the   method   of   above   calculation.  Accordingly   in   Shri \\n\\nMantreshwara every result is to be divided by 60 but according to other authorities \\n\\nthe division should be done by the whole measure.\\n\\n(1) The generally recognised method\\n\\nAdd the ghatikas elapsed of the nakshatra and those still to elapse. Thus we \\n\\nget the total number of ghatikas of the nakshatra. Mark these ghatikas as \\'A\\'.\\n\\nMark the ghatikas still to elapse as (B). Now suppose the birth has\\n\\ntaken place in the dasa of Jupiter, then the remainder of the dasa of Jupiter at \\n\\nbirth will be calculated as under:\\n\\n: If in A the dasa period is 16 years\\n\\n: In 1 it will be — 16/A\\n\\n: In B it will be — (16/A)*(B/1)\\n\\nThe result of this calculation will indicate the years, months, days etc., of the \\n\\nremainder of the dasa at birth.\\n\\n(2) Method of calculation according to Shri Mantreshwar —\\n\\n(16/A)*(B/1) years.\\n\\nThe difference is that in this method the total number of ghatikas are not \\n\\ntaken into account. \\'A\\' or the total numbner of ghatikas is always taken as 60. The \\n\\nremainder of the dasa only the basis of \\'B\\'.\\n\\nThis in our view is not correct as the total number of ghatikas are not always \\n\\n60.\\n\\nNow-a-days the easiest method of the remainder of the dasa accordingly is \\n\\nbased   on   the   longitude   of   the   Moon   3-13°-12\\'   (Cancer   13°-12\\').   Cancer   is \\n\\ncomposed of one quater or 3°-20\\' of Punarvasu, four quarters of Ashlesha. As the \\n\\nlongitude of 13°-12\\' in Cancer, it has passed the fourth quarter of Punarvasu in this \\n\\n175\\n\\n\\x0csign   and   is   in   Pushyami   nakshatra.   To   find   out   how   much   it   has   moved   in \\n\\nPushyami we will deduct 3°-20\\' of Punarvasu from the Moon\\'s 13°-12\\'. Thus the \\n\\nbalance will come to 9°-52\\'. The extent of the whole of Pushyami is 13°-20\\'. The \\n\\nlord of this nakshatra is Saturn whose total dasa period is 19 years. Therefore 13°-\\n\\n20\\' being equal to 19 years, 9°-52\\' will be equal to 14 years 0 months of 22 days. \\n\\nThis indicates that the 14 years and 22 days are observed over at birth and that \\n\\nwould remain at credit at birth will be 19 years minus 14 years 22 days, that is, 4 \\n\\nyears 11 months and 8 days.\\n\\nAll these detailed calculations will be avoided if we obtain the balance of \\n\\ndasa at birth on the longitude by referring to ready made tables in Lahiri\\'s annual \\n\\nEphemeris.\\n\\n4. Note the exact position of the Sun in the Zodiac at the time of birth when \\n\\nthe Sun in his next round arrives at the same position, it is considered as a solar \\n\\nyear, which is also the year taken for Udu adasa system (Vimsottari or naksharta \\n\\ndasa system). By subdividing the same, days are calculated.\\n\\n5. If the Sun be badly placed at the time of birth, he in the course of his dasa \\n\\ncauses quarrels and sudden wrath of the king, the ralatives will suffer from disease \\n\\nand the native will be wandering about. There will be intense anguish and danger \\n\\nfrom concealed wealth. The grain will be in danger of being burnt by fire and wife \\n\\nand sons (children) will be in distress.\\n\\n6. Acquisition of wealth through cruel deeds, journeys and quarrels, roaming \\n\\nthrough mountains and maintaining, real, renown success in ventures, severity in \\n\\ntemper and nature, devotion to duty and happiness, will be the effects during the \\n\\nDasa of the Sun if he is well placed.\\n\\n7. Peace of mind, success in all ventures, acquisition of wealth, good food, \\n\\ngains of wife, sons, clothes, ornaments cows, agricultural  land and devotion to \\n\\nBrahmins will be the effects during the dasa of the Moon.\\n\\n8. The effects of the dasa of the Moon described above will be derived in \\n\\nfull if the Moon be endowed with full strength. From the first of Shukla Paksha \\n\\nupto the tenth tithi, the Moon is possessed of medium strength. During this period \\n\\n176\\n\\n\\x0cthe effects will be medium. The ten days after, that is, from the 11th Tithi of the \\n\\nshukla paksha to  5th  Tithi  of  the  krishna  paksha  the  Moon is  of full  strength. \\n\\nTherefore, the good effects from such a Moon will be realised in full.\\n\\nDuring the remaining ten days i.e. from the sixth tithi of krishna paksha up \\n\\nto Amavasya the Moon begins to wane and becomes weaker and weaker. Very little \\n\\ngood effects will be derived from such a Moon.\\n\\n9. Effects like acquisition of wealth through fire, fighting etc., gain of money \\n\\nby   administering   falsehood,   cheating   and   cruel   actions,   suffering   always   form \\n\\nbilious complaints, impurity of blood and fever, intrigues with low class women, \\n\\nquarreling with his wife, children, relatives and elders and misery caused by it, and \\n\\nenjoyment of fortune of others, will be experienced in the dasa of Mars.\\n\\n10. Effects like meeting with friends, happiness, admiration from learned \\n\\npersons,   acquisition   of   fame,   beneficience   by   preceptors,   eloquency   in   speech, \\n\\nhelping others, happiness to wife, children, friends and relations are experienced in \\n\\nthe dasa of Mercury.\\n\\n11.   Effects   like   involvement   in   religious   affairs,   birth   of   children   or \\n\\nhappiness in respect of children, honour from the king, praise by distinguished \\n\\npersons,   acquisition   of   elephants,   horses   and   other   conveyances,   fullfilment   of \\n\\none\\'s ambitions and cordial relations with wife, children and meeting freinds, will \\n\\nbe experinced in the dasa of Jupiter.\\n\\n12.   Effects   like   obtaining   of   materials   and   facilities   for   his   sport   and \\n\\nhappiness,   acquisition   of   good   vehicles,   cows,   precious   stones,   ornaments,   a \\n\\ntreasure,   enjoyment   in   association   with   young   women,   intellectual   pursuits. \\n\\nJourney by sea (or river), conferment of honours by the king and celebration of \\n\\nauspicious funcitions in the house, will be derived in the dasa of Venus.\\n\\n13. Effects like his wife and children suffering from gout, rheumatism or \\n\\nsimilar   diseases,   loss   in   agriculture,   evil   talk,   intercourse   with   wicked   women, \\n\\ndesertion of servants, separation from wealth, will be realised by the native in the \\n\\ncourse of the dasa of Saturn.\\n\\n14.  There   will   be   during   the   dasa   of   Rahu   danger   from   the   king,   thief, \\n\\n177\\n\\n\\x0cpoison, fire  and weapons,  distress  to  children  mental  tension, loss  of  kinsmen, \\n\\nhumiliation  from   low   caste   people,   loss   of  reputation,  failure  and   losses  in  all \\n\\nventures and demotion in status.\\n\\n15. Rahu\\'s dasa will be full of auspicious effects if Rahu be associated with a \\n\\nbenefic or be posited in an auspicious house. The native will enjoy the spendour \\n\\nlike that of a king. He will achieve success in all his ventures and will live happily \\n\\nin his house. He will accumulate lasting wealth and his fame will spread far and \\n\\nwide on the Earth.\\n\\n16. It is the view of those learned in Astrology that Rahu in Virgo, Pisces or \\n\\nScorpio will give the person concerned during his dasa, honour and happiness, \\n\\nlordship of lands, conveyances and servants. All these will, however, be liable to \\n\\nbe lost at the conclusion of the dasa.\\n\\n17. Effects like danger from enemies, thieves, wrath of the king, fear of \\n\\ninjury from weapon, diseases caused by heat, a stigma to family of the native, fear \\n\\nfrom fire, deportation from the native place as a result of some serious accusation.\\n\\nNotes — In verses 5 to 17 the effects of the dasa of the Sun, the Moon, \\n\\nMars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus and Saturn in their usual order have been described \\n\\nin a general way.\\n\\nNow in verses 18 to 26 the effects of the dasa of all the planets have been \\n\\ndescribed  again  but  they  are  in the  order  prescribed  under  the  Vimsottari  dasa \\n\\nsystem.\\n\\nIt appears that the effects given in verses 5-17 are such as could be ascribed \\n\\nto the other dasa systems also.\\n\\nThere are some peculiarities in the Vimsottari dasa syatem, as the effects of \\n\\nthe dasas of planets will be governed by the rules laid down by Parasara. Under \\n\\nthese rules the lord of the 11th house (the house of gains) has been termed as papi. \\n\\nNot only that the lord of the 3rd and 6th also have been allotted that same title. The \\n\\nlord of the 3rd is the least papi and the lord of the 11th the biggest papi. Another \\n\\nrule is that if a benefic be the lord of a kendra, he does not produce benefic effects, \\n\\nand if the lord of a kendra be malefic, he does not produce inauspicious effects.\\n\\n178\\n\\n\\x0cTherefore the effects given in verses 5-17 should not apply to Vimsottari \\n\\ndasa system.\\n\\n18.   General   effects   like   acquisition   of   wealth   through   cruel   actions   or \\n\\nthrough kings or through fighting, buring in eyes, abdominal and dental disorders, \\n\\nserious trouble to wife and children, loses of servants, and wealth, separation from \\n\\nreverred elders and parents, will be dertvded during the dasa of the Sun.\\n\\nNotes — In our view these effects will be experienced if the Sun is not \\n\\nauspiciously disposed in any nativity. The Sun will definitely produce very good \\n\\nresults, if he is well phased. For example, in an Aries Langna nativity Sun as the \\n\\nlord of the 5th or in Sagittarius Lagna chart Sun as lord of the 9th in the 9th or 10th \\n\\nwill raise the native to dizzy heights.\\n\\n19. The general effects that will be experienced during the dasa of the Moon \\n\\nwill be gain of wealth through the mantras (hymns) and the beneficance of deities, \\n\\nBrahmins and the king, acquisition of wife, wealth, and agricultural land, gain of \\n\\nflowers, clothes, ornaments, and objects of enjoyment of various tastes. There will \\n\\nbe animosity with wicked people, loss of wealth and suffering from Rheumatism.\\n\\nNotes — In this verse both auspicious and inauspicious effects have been \\n\\ndescribed of the dasa of the Moon. The good effects should be retained if the Moon \\n\\nbe endowed with strength, be auspiciously posited and be lord of a favourable \\n\\nhouse. The adverse effects will be felt if the Moon be weak or be unfavourably \\n\\ndisposed.\\n\\n20. During the dasa of the Mars there will be, on the part of the native, \\n\\nefforts   to   earn   money   through   lands,   litigation   and   the   king.   He   will   acquire \\n\\nagricultural lands and cattle. There will be enmity with his son and brothers and he \\n\\nwill be attached to women of ill fame. He will suffer from impurity of blood, \\n\\ndiseases arising from heat and loss through fire. There will also be loss of wealth.\\n\\n21. General effects like becoming wicked in disposition, suffering from a \\n\\ndangerous disease, destruction of wife and children of the native, fear or danger \\n\\nfrom   poison,   distress   or   trouble   from   enemies,   diseases   of   the   eye   and   heart, \\n\\nanimosity with friends and servants working on agricultural land and animosity \\n\\n179\\n\\n\\x0cwith the king, will be experienced when the dasa of Rahu be in operation.\\n\\nNotes - Rahu and Ketu are shadowy planets. They are said to give effects \\n\\naccording to the houses they occupy according to the planets they are associated \\n\\nwith According to Laghu Parasari.\\n\\nThat is, if Rahu or Ketu be posited in kendra or trikona and be connected \\n\\nwith the lord of kendra or Trikona, they cause yoga which means they become \\n\\nyogakarakas. Rahu or ketu will definitely produce immensely good results when \\n\\nhis dasa be in operation. Lagna Parasari goes to the extent of Saying.\\n\\nThis means that if Rahu arid ketu are well placed (i.e. in the langa, the 5th or \\n\\n9th)   give   the   effects   of   a   yogakaraka   planet   in   the   an   tar   dasa   of   yogakaraka \\n\\nIrrespective of the fact whether they are connected or not with a yogakarka planet.\\n\\nSee also in this connection what has been said about the effects of Rahu if he \\n\\nis well disposed in verse 15th of this Chapter.\\n\\n22. Acquisition of new clothes, and such other objects, servants, retinue and \\n\\nsimilar grandeur, commanding great respect and dignity, birth of children, gain of \\n\\nwealth and friends, receipts of admiration for the eloquence of his speech, will be \\n\\nthe good effects when the dasa of Jupiter be in operation. The evil effects of dasa \\n\\nwill be separation from elders, ear disease and phelgmatic troubles.\\n\\n23. The general effects during the dasa of Saturn will be acquistion of wealth \\n\\nconsequent of the war or disturbances of the country, acquisition of servants and \\n\\nold women, cattle like buffaloes, and bulls, trouble to wife and children, suffering \\n\\nfrom windy  diseases like  rheumatism, gout  etc.,  phlegmatic diseases, piles and \\n\\nburning in hand and feet.\\n\\n24. During the dasa of Mercury the native will get the benefit of learning \\n\\nfrom preceptors or will himself become a very learned and influential preceptor. \\n\\nThere   will   be   gain   of   agricultural   lands,   cows   and   horses   and   money   from \\n\\nBrahmins. He will get into association with persons of high status. He will worship \\n\\ngods and acquire immense wealth. He will suffer from wind, heat and phlegm.\\n\\n25. During the dasa of Ketu the native will suffer from sorrow and confusion \\n\\ncaused by females, trouble from the rich and loss of wealth. He will do injustice to \\n\\n180\\n\\n\\x0cothers. He will be banished from his country (native place). He will suffer from \\n\\ndental trouble, pain in the legs and phlegmatic troubles.\\n\\nNotes - Please see our comments under verse 21 about the effects of the dasa \\n\\nof Rahu.\\n\\n26. Acquisition of wife, jewels, cloths, lustrous gems, concealed treasure, \\n\\nwealth,   ornaments,   horses,   conch,   etc.,   gain   of   money   from   trade,   agricultrual \\n\\npursutis, export and import of goods, separation from elders (like parents), loss of \\n\\npeace of mind  and distress to kinsmen, will be the general effects experienced \\n\\nduring the dasa of Venus.\\n\\nThus   ends   the   19th   Adhyaya   on   \"Dasas   and   their   Effects\"   in   the   work  \\n\\nPhaladeepika composed by Mantreswara.\\n\\n181\\n\\n\\x0cEffects of Dasas of the lords of houses and their Antar Dasas\\n\\nChapter 20\\n\\n1. This Chapter deals briefly with the effects of a planet as a result of his \\n\\nlordship  of a  house, when he  is strong,  with  the  effects  when he is  weak and \\n\\nconsequent effects that one has to undergo under circumstances.\\n\\n2. When the lagna is endowed with full strength, the native will during the \\n\\ndasa of the lord of the lagna attain a position of eminence in the world and live \\n\\nhappily. His body will remain sturdy and healthy and he will have lustre in his \\n\\nface. His prosperity will increase and his life will progress just as the Moon\\'s digits \\n\\nin the bright half of the lunar month.\\n\\n3.

He will \\n\\nreceive support of the people and will become popular for his good quality.\\n\\n5. If the 4th house be vested with maximum strength, effects like going good \\n\\nto   the   relation,   success   in   agricultural   pursuits,   happy   relations   with   wife, \\n\\nacquisition of a conveyance,  agricultural lands, houses, wealth, attainment of a \\n\\nhigher status, will be experienced by the native during the dasa of the lord of the \\n\\n4th house.\\n\\n6. If the 5th house be bestowed with full strength, effects like birth of a son, \\n\\nhappy associations and relationship with kinsmen, becoming minister of a king, \\n\\nconferment of honours, involvement in virtuous actions and praise for it from the \\n\\npeople and enjoyment of many kinds of delicious preparations shared with others, \\n\\nwill be derived during the dasa of the lord of the 5th house.\\n\\n7. If the 6th be very strongly disposed, effects like overcoming the enemies \\n\\n182\\n\\n\\x0cby his valour, remaining free from diseases, being generous and powerful, enjoying \\n\\nhis wealth, splendour and prosperity will be realised by the native during the dasa \\n\\nof the lord of the 6fh house.\\n\\n8. If the 7th house be endowed with full strength, during the dasa of the lord \\n\\nof the 7th, the native will acquire new clothes and ornaments and will live happily \\n\\nwith   his   wife.   His   virility   or   physical   strength   will   Increase   and   auspicious \\n\\nfunctions   like   marriage   etc.,   will   be   celebrated   in   his   house.   He   will   perform \\n\\npleasure trips.\\n\\n9. If the lord of 8th house be vested with full strength, during his dasa period \\n\\nthe   native   will   be   able   to   clear   all   his   debts.   He   will   achieve   progress   in   his \\n\\nprofession and other activities. All disputes with him will come to an end and he \\n\\nwill acquire buffaloes, goats and other cattle and servants.\\n\\n10. If the lord of 9th house be fully strong, during his dasa, the native will \\n\\nenjoy continuous prosperity, happiness and wealth alongwith his wife, sons, grand \\n\\nchildren and relations, will perform meritorious deeds and receive royal favour and \\n\\nwill be respectful to Brahmins and gods.\\n\\n11. If the 10th house and its lord have full strength, in the dasa of the lord of \\n\\nthe 10th house, the native will succeed in every venture he undertakes, and he will \\n\\nlive happily. He will earn name and fame and will attain good reputation. He will \\n\\ninvolve himself in virtuous actions for which he receives humiliations.\\n\\n12. In the dasa of a strong lord of the 11th there will be continuous growth in \\n\\nprosperity. He will have meetings with his near relatives and will have the comfort \\n\\nof many servants. There will be domestic happiness and great prosperity.\\n\\n13.   During   the   dasa   of   the   lord   of   the   12th,   the   native   will   spend \\n\\nextravagantly on good causes. He will perform meritorious acts and thus be free \\n\\nfrom   the   evil   effects   of   the   sins   committed.   He   will   also   be   conferred   royal \\n\\nhonours.\\n\\n14. The good effects described above in verses 2 to 13 are derived only \\n\\nwhen the lord of the house concerned is auspiciously disposed (not placed in the \\n\\n6th, 8th, or  12th), is posited in his own sign or  in his sign of exaltation  or  is \\n\\n183\\n\\n\\x0cretrograde. The effects will be adverse if such a planet is inauspiciously disposed, \\n\\nis in his inimical sign, in his sign of debilitation or is eclipsed by the Sun\\'s rays. \\n\\nNow described below are the effects of the planet (lord of a house), who is not well \\n\\ndisposed.\\n\\n15.   When   the   lord   of   the   Lagna   is   badly   placed,   the   native   will   be \\n\\nimprisoned   during   his   dasa.   He   will   lead   his   life   in   cognito,   will   suffer   fear, \\n\\ndiseases and mental anguish, will participate  in funeral rites, will incur loss of \\n\\nposition and other misfortunes.\\n\\nIf the lord of the 2nd is in a similar position, the person conscemed during \\n\\nhis dasa will behave stupidly before an audiance, will not stick to his word or \\n\\nfamily, write objectionable letters, will suffer from eye troubles, will have a harsh \\n\\ntongue, incur lot of expenditure and will face displeasure of the king.\\n\\n16. If the lord of the 3rd house be weak, there will be loss of brothers and \\n\\nsisters during  his dasa. His work will receive  adverse criticism and he will be \\n\\nharassed by secret enemies. The native will suffer from reverse and as a result will \\n\\nbe humiliated and lose his pride.\\n\\nIf the lord of the 4th house be weak, during his dasa the mother of the native, \\n\\nhis kinsmen and his friends will be distressed. There will be danger of destruction \\n\\nof his house, agricultural lands and cattle and also danger from water.\\n\\n17. If the lord of the 5th lacks strength and is badly placed, during his dasa, \\n\\nthe native will lose a son. He will suffer from aberration of mind, will be a victim \\n\\nof deception and will wander here and there aimlessly. He will suffer from stomach \\n\\ndisorders, face wrath or displeasure of king and will feel physicially weak.\\n\\nDuring the dasa of the lord of the 6th house who is deficient in strength, \\n\\nthere will be danger from thieves. He will face poverty, will be overpowered by \\n\\nothers and will suffer from diseases, will receive shabby treatment or indulge in \\n\\nundesirable   actions.   He   will   serve   others   and   suffer   humiliation   and   loss   of \\n\\nreputation. He will have injuries in his body.\\n\\n18. If the lord of the 7th be weak, during his dasa, the son-in-law of the \\n\\nnative   will   be   in   distress.  The   native   will   make   separation   from   his   wife   and \\n\\n184\\n\\n\\x0csomething untoward will happen through the opposite sex and he will have affairs \\n\\nwith wicked women and will suffer from venereal diseases. He will be wandering \\n\\naimlessly.\\n\\nWhen the  dasa  of  a badly  placed  and  weak lord  of the  8th  house  be in \\n\\noperation, the person concerned will suffer from great sorrow, loss of intelligence, \\n\\nintense sexual  desire,  jealousy, fainting  fits,  poverty, fruitless  rambling,  loss of \\n\\nreputation, sickness and humiliation. Even his life may end during the dasa of such \\n\\na planet.\\n\\n19. During the dasa of the lord of 9th house who is weak, the wife and \\n\\nchildren of the native will be in trouble. He will suffer in many ways due to wrath \\n\\nof deity that had been worshipped formerly. He will indulge in undesirable actions \\n\\nand one of his elder brothers and his father may die and he himself may suffer \\n\\nfrom penury.\\n\\nWhen the lord of the 10th house be devoid of strength, during his dasa, the \\n\\nnative   will   face   failure   in   all   his   undertakings   and   he   will   indulge   in   wicked \\n\\nactions, he may have to live away from his homeland and may suffer distress on \\n\\nthat account.  He will have to face untoward happenings and will incur  loss of \\n\\nhonour.\\n\\n20. If the lord of the 11th be adversely disposed and be weak, the brother \\n\\n(elder) of the native will be in trouble. His son will be sickly, he (the native) will \\n\\nsuffer from misery, deception and ear diseases.\\n\\nDuring the dasa of a weak lord of the 12th house, the native will suffer from \\n\\nmany   diseases,   dishonour   and   slavery.  All   his   wealth   will   disappear   like   the \\n\\n(waning) Moon in the dark half of the month.\\n\\n21. Whatever has been stated in the Chapter 1, whatever has been mentioned \\n\\nas  belonging  to   the  presiding  planets  (Chapter   2),   whatever  calling   is  declared \\n\\nappropriate   in   chapter   on   profession   (Chapter   5),   whatever   diseases   have   been \\n\\ndescribed as due to the several planets (Chapter 14), whatever has been said as the \\n\\neffects of the aspect or association with the planets (Chapter 18), or of the presence \\n\\nof   planets   in   houses   or   of   the   lords   of   the   several   houses   or   the   lord   being \\n\\n185\\n\\n\\x0cassociated with others (Chapter 15, 16, 17), all this must be duly assigned to the \\n\\nplanets concerned in their respective dasas.\\n\\n22. If a planet occupies Vargottamamsa he produces very favourable effects \\n\\nin his dasa. Mixed effects are derived in the dasa of a planet who being Vargottama \\n\\nis in his sign of deblitation or is eclipsed by the Sun\\'s rays. Adverse results may be \\n\\nwhen the dasa of any of the lord of the 6th, 8th or 12th house in the an tar dasa of \\n\\nany of them be in operation. Similar will be the effect of the dasa of the planet \\n\\nposited in the 6th, 8th, or 12th and an tar dasa of any one of them.\\n\\n23. There will be theft in the house of the native, he will be troubled by \\n\\nenemies and he will suffer great misery, during the dasa of a cruel planet (malefic) \\n\\nand the an tar dasa of any of the lords of the 3rd, 5th or 7th nakshatra reckoned \\n\\nfrom the Janma nakshatra (natal star). The same will be the results in the dasa of a \\n\\nmalefic and in the antar dasa of the lord of the Moon sign or of the 8th house there \\n\\nfrom.\\n\\n24. The following dasas will bring misery and trouble :-\\n\\n(1) The dasa of Saturn if it is the fourth in the order of main dasas.\\n\\n(2) The dasa of Jupiter if it is the sixth\\n\\n(3) The dasa of the Mars and Rahu if they are fifth.\\n\\n(4) The dasa of a planet who is placed in the last degree of a sign.\\n\\n(5) The dasas of the lords of the 6th, 8th and 12th houses.\\n\\nNotes — If any body is born in the dasa of Mars, Saturn\\'s dasa will be the \\n\\nfourth for him. For one born in the dasa of Venus, Rahu dasa will be fifth and \\n\\nJupiter\\'s dasa the sixth for him. For one born in the dasa of Ketu, Mars dasa will be \\n\\nthe fifth for him.\\n\\n25. If Mars in an Urdhvamukha sign or in his sign of exaltation be posited in \\n\\nthe 10th or 11th house, the native will acquire a kingdom in his dasa. He will \\n\\nbecome   a   king   and   cause   destruction   of   his   enemies   and   will   possess   many \\n\\nvehicles and a huge army and\\n\\n26. If Venus be in his sign of exaltation or in his own sign and be posited in \\n\\nthe   10th,   11th   or   the   12th   house,   uneclipsed   and   free   from   the   influence   of   a \\n\\n186\\n\\n\\x0cmalefic, the native during his dasa, will become very wealthy, will be full of glory \\n\\nand splendour and will be endowed with gold and precious stones etc., will be \\n\\nwidely praised and enjoy all comforts.\\n\\n27. All benefics if placed in their sign of debilitation, inimical signs or the \\n\\n6th or 12th house, they will produce only adverse results while malefic similarly \\n\\nplaced will cause miseries during their dasa periods.\\n\\n28. The native will face danger from enemies, suffer loss or position and \\n\\nearn hostility oi persons who had been his friends, during the dasa of a planet and \\n\\nthe an tar dasa of the planet (1) who is inimical to the lord of the dasa, (2) who is in \\n\\nan inimical sign, (3) one who is posited in the 6th or (4) who is inimical to lord of \\n\\nthe lagna.\\n\\n29. Which ever house counted from the lord of the dasa is occupied by the \\n\\nlord of antar dasa, it is the effects arising from that house during the antar dasa is \\n\\nposited in 6th, 8th or 12th with reference to the lord of the dasa. In other positions \\n\\nthe effects will be good.\\n\\n30.   If   a   benefic   or   a   lord   of   a   benefic   house   is   posited   in   his   sign   of \\n\\nexaltation, he produces maximum good effects. The effects will be three-fourth if \\n\\nsuch a planet be in his Moolatrikona sign. It will be half if he be in his own sign. It \\n\\nwill be one-fourth in a friend\\'s sign, very little in his inimical sign and almost nil \\n\\nwhen it is in his sign of debilitation. In the case of malefics or lords of malefic \\n\\nhouses the results will be reversed. When a planet is in combustion its effect will \\n\\nbe similar to that in his sign of debilitation.\\n\\n31. Find out which amongst the following is the weakest — (a) Saturn, (b) \\n\\nMandi, (c) Rahu, (d) the lord of the 22nd decanate from the lagna, (e) lord of the \\n\\n8th, (f) lords of the navamsa signs occupied by them. It is the dasa of the weakest \\n\\namongst   them   that   proves   fatal   for   the   native   and   the   death   takes   place   when \\n\\nSaturn in the course of his transit passes through an untoward house (6th, 8th or \\n\\n12th).\\n\\n32. See who amongst the following pairs of planets is stronger-la) the lord of \\n\\nthe house occupied by the lord of the 8th house and lord of the navamsa sign \\n\\n187\\n\\n\\x0coccupied by the lord of the 8th house. And the lord of the 22nd decamate from the \\n\\nlagna and the lord of decanate of the lagna. The death of the native takes place \\n\\nwhen Jupiter in the course of his transit passes through any of the following places \\n\\n—\\n\\n(1) the sign occupied by the lord of the 8th house, (2) the navamsa occupied \\n\\nby the lord of the 8th house, (3) in trlkona position to (1) and (2).\\n\\n33. If Jupiter, the lord of the house occupied by the Moon and the lord of the \\n\\nlagna be posited in kendra at birth, the middle portion of the life will be happy. \\n\\nPlanets in shirshodaya, ubhayodaya and prishtodaya signs give their results in the \\n\\nbeginning, in the middle and in the end respectively.\\n\\n34. If the lord of the dasa be endowed with strength at the time of birth \\n\\npasses in the course of his transit through his sign of exaltation, his own sign or a \\n\\nfriend\\'s sign, promotes the growth of the house reckoned from the lagna.\\n\\nNotes — Suppose Rahu is endowed with full strength in a nativity, his dasa \\n\\nis in progress when in the course of his transit he will pass through the 11th house \\n\\ncounted   from   the   lagna   the   native   will   have   gains   of   wealth.  When   he   passes \\n\\nthrough the 10th in transit, the native will get promotion in his position. When it \\n\\nwill pass through the 9th the native will have dawn of fortune.\\n\\n35. When a planet who\\'s dasa is in progress be weak at birth, be eclipsed by \\n\\nthe Sun\\'s rays, be in his sign of debilitation or be in a inimical sign, he will during \\n\\nthe course of transit through any house, cause its total destruction.\\n\\nNotes — Suppose the lagna is Virgo and Saturn is posited in the 8th house in \\n\\nhis sign of debilitation. During the dasa of Saturn, if in the course of his transit he \\n\\npasses   through   the   sign   Leo   which   is   an   inimical   sign   identical   with   the   12th \\n\\nhouse, the 12th house will produce very evil effects during that period.\\n\\n36.  The   effects   will   be   good   and   auspicious,   when   in   the   course   of   his \\n\\ntransit, the Moon passes through (1) the exaltation house of the lord of the dasa, (2) \\n\\nthe houses friendly to the lord of the dasa and (3) the 3rd, 5th, 6th, 7th, 9th, 10th \\n\\nand 11th houses reckoned from the lord of the dasa.\\n\\nNotes   —   If   any   person   wants,   to   know   whether   the   Moon   will   give \\n\\n188\\n\\n\\x0causpicious effects on a particular day, he should expect good effects if the Moon is \\n\\nin any one of the positions mentioned above with the lord of the dasa in progress.\\n\\n37. If a planet whose antar dasa is in operation should on the course of his \\n\\ntransit   at   the   time   pass   through   his   sign   of   debilitation,   an   inimical   house   or \\n\\nbecome eclipsed, there will  be much misery. Should  he pass through his own, \\n\\nexaltation house or be retrograde, the effects will then be good.\\n\\n38.   If   the   antar   dasa   of   a   planet   is   favourable,   the   good   effects   will   be \\n\\nexperienced when the Sun, in the course of his transit, passes through his sign of \\n\\nexaltation. Similar effects will be derived when Jupiter in the course of his transit \\n\\npasses through that sign of exaltation. As regards the planet whose antar dasa is \\n\\nlikely to yield inauspicious or adverse effects, such evil effects will be realised \\n\\nwhen the Sun in the course of his transit passes through the antar dasa lord\\'s sign of \\n\\ndebilitation or inimical sign.\\n\\n39. Rahu  will   affect  the  planet   with  whom  he is  associated.  That  planet \\n\\nthrough good and auspicious by himself will produce evil effects particularly at the \\n\\nend of his dasa.\\n\\nNotes — In the example horoscope, Rahu is associated with Venus who is \\n\\nposited in  his  own sign. Rahu  will  take  over  the  nature  and  auspiciousness  of \\n\\nVenus and produce effects in dasa or antar dasa according to them. Venus on the \\n\\nother hand will become afflicted and produce evil effects during his dasa or antar \\n\\ndasa particlarly at their end.\\n\\n189\\n\\n\\x0cL\\n\\nRAHU\\nVEN\\n\\n40. The 2nd and 7th houses are maraka (death producing) houses. If the \\n\\nlords of these houses or planets posited therein, are powerful they cause death \\n\\nduing their dasa. If the lord of the 8th or 12th house be very weak, death is likely to \\n\\ntake place in the an tar dasa of any of the two.\\n\\n41.  The   dasa   of   a   planet   who   is   lord   of   a   kendra   will   be   adverse   if   he \\n\\nhappens to be a benefic natural benefic and auspicious or favourable if he is a \\n\\n(natural)   malefic.  The   dasa   of   all   the   planets   who   are   trikonas   (1,5,9)   will   be \\n\\nfavourable. The lords of the 3rd, 6th and 11th houses, even if benefics, they will \\n\\nalways produce evil effects during their dasas. The lord of the 8th house, if he also \\n\\nis the lord of the lagna will be auspicious and will produce good effects in his dasa. \\n\\nThe Sun and the Moon even if they own the 8th house give only good effects. \\n\\n(They do not suffer from the stigma of being lords of the 8th house.) These are the \\n\\neffects of several dasas according to Parasara\\'s opinion.\\n\\n42. If (1) the lord of a trikona be in a kendra, (2) the lord of a kendra be in a \\n\\ntrikona, they will both prove auspicious. If the dasa of one and the an tar dasa of \\n\\nthe ohter be in operation, the effects will be very favourable. They will help each \\n\\nother, cooperate to make the period auspicious.\\n\\n43. No planet produces good or bad effects to the native in accordance with \\n\\nthe house he owns during his dasa and his own antar dasa.\\n\\n190\\n\\n\\x0c44.   Find   out   what   all   planets   are   related   (Chapter   25,   verse   30)   to   the \\n\\nparticular planet whose dasa is under consideration. Note also the planets if any \\n\\nwhich are similarly circumstanced (whether for good or bad) i.e. holding a position \\n\\ncoordinate to the one under reference. It is only in the antar dasas of these planets \\n\\nthat the original planet will in his main dasa manifest his effect.\\n\\n45. The lords of kendras and trikonas, even if they themselves be capable of \\n\\ncausing evil (owning to their having lordships of evil house), become yogakarakas \\n\\nby their mere relationship and make the native prosperous.\\n\\nNotes — For example for the Aries Ascendant both Saturn lord of the 10th a \\n\\nkendra and also of 11th (for which he beccmes a papi) and Jupiter is lord of the 9th \\n\\na trikona and the 6th a dusthana. But they get related with each other (vide Chapter \\n\\n15, verse 30) they become yogakarakas and thus auspicious in the nature.\\n\\n46. If out of the lords of the 5th and 9th any one of them gets related to a \\n\\nstrong planet owning a kendra, he becomes a yogakaraka, (capable of promoting \\n\\nthe property of the native).\\n\\n47. If the lord of a kendra be associated with any of the lords of the 5th or \\n\\nthe 9th, they both become yogakarakas.\\n\\nIf the lord of a kendra while being related to lord of one trikona, be also \\n\\nrelated to the lord of the other trikona, a most powerful Raja Yoga will be the \\n\\nresult.\\n\\nNotes — Here it will be relevant to point out that if the same planet owns a \\n\\nkendra and a trikona, he becomes a yogakaraka for that ascendant. For the Taurus \\n\\nAscendant Saturn is lord of 9th and 10th. Therefore he will be a yogakaraka. For \\n\\nthe Cancer and Leo Ascendants Mars owns the 5th and the 10th and the 4th and 9th \\n\\nrespectively.   Thus   Mars   is   a   yogakaraka   for   these   Ascendants.   Saturn   is   a \\n\\nYogakaraka for the Libra ascendant being the lord of the 4th and the 5th. Venus is \\n\\nyogakaraka for the Capricorn and Aquarius ascendants being lords of the 5th and \\n\\nthe 10th and the 4th and the 9th respectively.\\n\\n48. Though the planets may be themselves (natural malefics) but If they are \\n\\nrelated   to   a   yogakaraka   (planet   producing   prosperity)   good   effects   will   be \\n\\n191\\n\\n\\x0cexperienced by the native during their antar dasas leading him to affluence and \\n\\nhappiness.\\n\\n49. The lord of a trikoria house will during his dasa and the antar dasa of the \\n\\nlord of a kendra will produce good effects. Even if the two planets may not be \\n\\nconnected the dasa of one and the antar dasa of the other will be productive of \\n\\ngood effects.\\n\\n50-51. If Jupiter and Venus be lords of kendras, they become powerful to \\n\\ncause   evil   effects.   Should   they   occupy   the   maraka   houses   (2nd   and   7th),   they \\n\\nbecome powerful marakas (inflicters of death).\\n\\nMercury in this respect is less powerful. The Moon comes next to Mercury.\\n\\nMalefics when they be lords of kendras, become more and more auspicious \\n\\nin their effects.\\n\\n52. If Rahu and Ketu occupy a kendra or trikona they become yogakarakas if \\n\\nthey get connected with the lord of kendra or trikona.\\n\\nIf   Rahu   or   Ketu   should   occupy   the   sign   of   a   benefic   which   is   not   an \\n\\ninauspicious   house   and   are   not   connected   with   any   planet,   they   produce   good \\n\\neffects in their antar dasas.\\n\\nIf Rahu and Ketu are not connected with any planet and are posited in an \\n\\nauspicious house (kendra or trikona), they will produce good effects during their \\n\\ndasa and the antar dasa of a yogakaraka.\\n\\n54. During the dasa of a yogakaraka planet, the Raja Yoga begins when the \\n\\nantar dasa of karaka planets are in progress. The antar dasas of malefics which \\n\\nsucceed them in their turn increase the same.\\n\\nNotes — Another version of this verse as given by Pt. Gopesh Kumar Ojha \\n\\nin his Hindi translation of Phaladeepika is as under :—\\n\\nThis means that if Raja yoga begins with the antar dasa of a maraka planet, \\n\\nthe native gets yogakaraka effects in name only. The real prosperity and glorious \\n\\neffects of Raja yoga evade him.\\n\\n55. The following planets cause great misery to the native —\\n\\n(1) The planet posited in the 8th house.\\n\\n192\\n\\n\\x0c(2) The planet who aspects the 6th house.\\n\\n(3) The lord of the 8th house.\\n\\n(4) The planet owning the decanate of the 8th house.\\n\\n(5) The planet owning the sign occupied by Mandi.\\n\\nFrom amongst the weakest will be capable of causing death of the native \\n\\nduring his dasa or antar dasa.\\n\\n56.   The   dasa   of   a   planet   fallen   from   exaltation   is   termed  Avarohini   or \\n\\ndescending,   while   that   of   a   planet   in   a   friend\\'s   house   is   named   Madhya   or \\n\\nmiddling. The dasa of a planet proceeding from his debilitation is called Arohini or \\n\\nascending.   The   dasa   of   a   planet   that   is   actually   in   his   depression   or   inimical \\n\\nnavamsa is termed, Adhama or worst\\n\\nNotes — It has already been mentioned earlier at which degree of a sign a \\n\\nplanet is in deep exaltation and what degree of a particular sign the planet is in \\n\\ndebilitation. For example the Sun is in deep exaltation at 10 degrees of Aries and \\n\\nhe   is   in   deep   debilitation   at   10   degrees   of   Libra.   During   the   interval   the   Sun \\n\\nproceeds from 10 degrees of Libra trowards to 10 degrees of Aries and until he \\n\\nreaches there, he will be called Arohi or ascending. But the interval, the Sun after \\n\\nreaching 10 degrees Aries proceeds 10 degrees of Libra and until he reaches there, \\n\\nhe will be termed as Avarohi or descending. The effects of the dasa of an avarohi \\n\\nplanet are bad, while the effects of an Arohi planet are good. But even if a planet \\n\\nbe Avarohi his dasa will be ordinarily favourable if he is posited in his exalted or \\n\\nfriend\\'s Navamsa, while even if a planet be arohi. If he be posited in his sign of \\n\\ndepression, in an inimical sign, in debilitated navamsa or in an Inimical navamsa, \\n\\nhis dasa will be Adhama or adverse.\\n\\n57. Even if a planet be in his sign of debilitation or in his Inimical sign or be \\n\\neclipsed by the Sun\\'s rays, his dasa will produce mixed effects, if he occupies an \\n\\nauspicious house or Navamsa and will be capable of giving good effects in the \\n\\nlatter half of the dasa.\\n\\n58. Death of the relative signified by a particular house will take place In the \\n\\nmain dasa of the planet in the house 12th to that house or of the planet owning it, \\n\\n193\\n\\n\\x0cwhoever is weaker.\\n\\n59. If the lord of the dasa in the course of his transit passes through the \\n\\nlagna, the 3rd, the 6th, the 10th or 11th house reckoned from him or If the lord of \\n\\nthe dasa comes to the sapta varga places of the lagna, or when a friendly planet or a \\n\\nbenefic planet comes to the lagna, the Dasa will prove auspicious at that time i.e. \\n\\nduring the periods of transits mentioned above.\\n\\n60. Note which planet\\'s dasa or antar dasa is in progress and where he is \\n\\nsituated in the course of his transit with reference to the natal Moon. The dasa or \\n\\nantar dasa will produce good effects during the periods of the lords of the dasa or \\n\\nin the course of his transit comes to auspicious places with reference to the natal \\n\\nMoon and Dasa effects will be adverse if the lord of dasa comes to inauspicious \\n\\nhouses from the position of natal Moon.\\n\\n61. The Moon produces beneficial effects when in the course of her transit, \\n\\nshe passes through (1) the friend\\'s house of the lord of the Dasa (2) the sign in \\n\\nwhich the lord of the dasa is exalted and (3) houses 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10 and 11 from the \\n\\nlord of the dasa.\\n\\n62. In the favourable positions mentioned in the previous verse, the sign \\n\\noccupied by the Moon should represent some one of the 12 house, lagna, wealth \\n\\netc.,   at   the   time   of   birth.  The   one   of   these   favourable   positions   promotes   the \\n\\nprosperity   in   respect   of   the   house   represented   by   the   sign   occupied.   In   the \\n\\nunfavourable positions, the house represented by the sign occupied by the Moon \\n\\nsuffers damage.\\n\\n63. While assessing the various effects in a nativity it is admirable to study \\n\\nthe   principles   laid   down   in   Saravali   (by   Kalyana   Varma),   Hora   Shastra   by \\n\\nVarahamihira and the Nakshatra Dasa. While making such an assessment, careful \\n\\nnote should be taken of the planets with reference to the lagna at the time of query \\n\\nor janma rasi (Moon sign) or Lagna at birth. There will not be much difference \\n\\nbetween   the   Prasna   Lagna   and   the   Janma   Lagna   in   the   matter   of   making \\n\\npredictions.\\n\\nNotes — Sloka 32. — It may be interesting to note why Jupiter has been \\n\\n194\\n\\n\\x0cparticularly mentioned for causing the death of the person when he transits through \\n\\nthe   Rasi   and   the   Navamsa   occupied   by   the   Lord   of   the   eighth   house   or   its \\n\\ntriangular   position.  The   reader   will   note   that   Jupiter   is   the   only   planet   who  is \\n\\nexalted in the eighth house from his own sign. It only shows the magnanimity of \\n\\nthe planet who is defined to exhibit his full lustre even when he is posited in a bad \\n\\nhouse as the 8th house. This is because he is a Philosopher.\\n\\nSloka 41. — The Sun and the Moon are declared to be auspicious even when \\n\\nthey own the 8th house. i.e. for the people born in Makara and Dhanus they are \\n\\nrespectively auspicious. This is because the Sun becomes the creater for person \\n\\nborn in Makara, while the Moon becomes the owner of the house in which lord of \\n\\nDhauns (Jupiter) is exalted. It is therefore relevant that both these planets should \\n\\nprove auspicous to persons torn In Makara Lagna and Dhanus Lagna respectively.\\n\\nSloka 54. — The lord of a Kendra and Kona is termed the Yogakaraka.\\n\\nThus   ends   the   twentieth   chapter   on   \"Dasas   of   Bhava   Lords   and   their  \\n\\nBhukties\" in Phaladeepika composed by Mantreswara.\\n\\n195\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 21\\n\\nDivisions of a sign\\n\\n1. In this chapter is explained the method of calculating the antar dasa and \\n\\npratyantar   dasa.   There   are   antar   dasas   of   all   the   nine   planets   in   a   dasa.   For \\n\\nexample, in the dasa of the Sun there will be the antar dasas of the Sun and all the \\n\\nother planets. The first antar dasa is of the same planet who is the lord of the dasa. \\n\\nFor example, in the dasa of Jupiter the order of antar dasas will be Jupiter, Saturn, \\n\\nMercury, Ketu, Venus, the Sun, the Moon, Mars and Rahu. In the dasa of Venus the \\n\\norder of antar dasa will be venus, the Sun, the Moon, Mars, Rahu, Jupiter, Saturn, \\n\\nMercury and Ketu.\\n\\nAs there are nine antar dasas in a dasa, there are nine pratyantar dasas in an \\n\\nantar dasa. The first pratyantar dasa will be of the lord of antar dasa.\\n\\nWhatever has been here described as effects of any planet, all this should \\n\\noccur in the planet\\'s dasa, in his antar dasa and in his pratyantar dasa.\\n\\n2. The period of antar dasa in a dasa should be calculated by the rule of \\n\\nthree. Suppose if we have to know the duration of antar dasa of the Sun in the dasa \\n\\nof Venus we should proceed as explained below. In 120 years the Sun\\'s portion is \\n\\nof 6years. In 1 year the Sun\\'s portion will be (6/120)*1. Therefore, in 20 years the \\n\\nSun will have Antar Dasa of (6*1/120)*20 = 1 year.\\n\\nThe Sun\\'s dasa is of 6 years and the dasa of Venus is of 20 years. Therefore \\n\\nthe figures of 20 and 6 have been taken above. The pratyantar dasa in any case can \\n\\nalso be calculated in the same manner. We have found out that in the dasa of Venus \\n\\nthe duration of Sun\\'s an tar dasa is 1 year. Now let us find out how much will be \\n\\nthe duration of pratyantar dasa of the Sun in his antar dasas.\\n\\nIn 120 years the duration is 6 years\\n\\nIn 1 year it will be (6*1/120) = 1/20 years\\n\\n(1/20)*360 days = 18 days.\\n\\nThus in the dasa of Venus, the duration of the pratyantar dasa of the Sun in \\n\\nhis antar dasa will be 18 days.\\n\\n196\\n\\n\\x0cThese   informations   are   available   in   readymade   tables   in   the   various \\n\\nPanchangas which can be usefully utilised.\\n\\nNotes   —   Shri   V.   Subrahmaniam   Sastry   has   explained   the   method   of \\n\\ncalculation as under :—\\n\\n\"Multiply the years of maha dasa by the years of the planet whose antar dasa \\n\\nis required. Divide the period by 120. The quotient will represent the years of antar \\n\\ndasa. Multiply the remainder by 12 and divide the result by 120. The quotient will \\n\\nrepresent   the   months,   multiply   the   remainder   by   30   and   divide   by   120.   The \\n\\nquotient will give the days and so on. The same process should be adopted for \\n\\ncalculating the sub-divisions. In any dasa the order of the antar dasa is similar to \\n\\nthat in the dasa of the first antar dasa commencing with that of its lord.\"\\n\\nThere   is   an   easy   method   by   mean   of   which   the   antar   dasa   can   be \\n\\nindependently calculated. This may be helpful at times when the antar dasa tables \\n\\nare not readily available.\\n\\nMultiply the number of years of dasa period of the planet by the number of \\n\\nyears of dasa of the period of the planet antar dasa is required. The last figure in \\n\\nthe product always represents the decimal of a month and the rest represents the \\n\\ntotal number of months. Then cutting of the last digit of the product, multiuply it \\n\\nby 3 and keep that figure as days. Suppose we want to find out the antar dasa of \\n\\nMercury in the dasa of Saturn. Multiply the dasa period of Mercury 17 years by \\n\\nthat of Saturn viz. 19 years i.e. 19*17 = 323. By adopting the above method the \\n\\nantar dasa of Mercury will be 32 months and 9 days i.e. 2 years 8 months 9 days.\\n\\nEffects of antar dasas in the dasa of the Sun.\\n\\n3. During the antar dasa of the Sun in his dasa. the person born will achieve \\n\\nrenown by the beneficience of the king. He will acquire wealth and wander about \\n\\nin mountain and forest regions and will suffer from fever and heat troubles. He \\n\\nmay lose his father. Notes — The good effects may be expected when the Sun be \\n\\nwell placed and the evil effects will occur when the Sun is adversely posited.\\n\\n4. Effects like destruction of enemies, relief from distress, influx of wealth, \\n\\nacquisition of agricultural lands, building a house and meeting with friends are the \\n\\n197\\n\\n\\x0clikely effects to be experienced by the native in the antar dasa of the Moon in the \\n\\ndasa   of   the   Sun.   If   the   Moon   be   adversely   placed   the   native   will   suffer   from \\n\\nconsumption, watery diseases and there will be danger \\'for the native.\\n\\n5. Effects like sickness, loss of position, troubles from enemies, animosity \\n\\nwith kinsmen, fear from the king, destruction of wealth and ulcers in the body etc., \\n\\nwill be derived by the native in the antar dasa of Mars in the dasa of the Sun.\\n\\n6. Effects like rise of enemies, enmity with  others,  loss of wealth,  theft, \\n\\ndisaster,   fear   from   poison,   headache,   eye   troubles   and   inclination   towards \\n\\nenjoyment of material comforts, will be realised by the native in the antar dasa of \\n\\nRahu and the dasa of the Sun.\\n\\n7.   Effects   like   destruction   of   enemies,   influx   of   many   kinds   of   wealth, \\n\\nregular   worship   of   gods.   Brahmin,   preceptor,   entertainment   of   kinsmen,   ear \\n\\ntroubles and diseases like tuberculosis, may be expected by the native in the antar \\n\\ndasa of Jupiter in the dasa of the Sun.\\n\\nNotes — The evil effects mentioned  above should arise  when Jupiter be \\n\\nadversely disposed.\\n\\n8. Effects like loss of wealth, separation from the son, diseases to wife, death \\n\\nof   an   elderly   person   (preceptor,   father,   uncle   etc.),   excessive   expenditure, \\n\\ndestruction   of   clothes   and   other   domestic   articles,   filthiness,   and   phlegmatic \\n\\ntroubles, will be experienced by the native in the antar dasa of Saturn in the dasa of \\n\\nthe Sun.\\n\\n9. Effects like suffering from cutaneous eruptions, boils, leprosy, jaundice, \\n\\npains in the waist and stomach, and troubles from all the three humours viz., bile, \\n\\nphlegm and wind, will be derived by the native, in the antar dasa of Mercury in the \\n\\ndasa of the Sun.\\n\\n10. Effects like loss of freinds, misunderstanding with the members of the \\n\\nfamily, fear from enemies, loss of wealth, illness of an elderly relation and pains in \\n\\nthe leg, severe headache, will be felt by the native in the antar dasa of Ketu in the \\n\\ndasa of the Sun.\\n\\n11. Effects like headache, disorders  of stomach, pain  in  the  anus (piles), \\n\\n198\\n\\n\\x0ccarrying out of agricultural venture, loss of house and wealth, shortage of grain and \\n\\nillness of children and wife, will be experienced in the antar dasa of Venus in the \\n\\ndasa of the Sun.\\n\\nEffects of antardasa in the dasa of the Moon\\n\\n12. Birth of daughters, acquisition of clean and bright clothes, meeting with \\n\\nrespected Brahmin, happiness to mother and enjoyment of comforts of the couch, \\n\\nwill be the likely effects in the antar dasa of the Moon in her own dasa.\\n\\n13.   Bilious   troubles,   troubles   from   fire,   diseases   caused   by   impurity   of \\n\\nblood, distress from enemies and thieves, unhappiness, and loss of wealth, will be \\n\\nlikely effects that will be derived by the native, in the antar dasa of Mars in the \\n\\ndasa of the Moon.\\n\\nNotes - In our view for the Cancer and Leo Ascendant for which Mars is \\n\\nyogakarka,   the   effects   of   the   antar   dasa   will   be   excellent   in   the   matter   of \\n\\nacquisition of wealth, growth of prosperity and earning name and fame, if Mars be \\n\\nwell disposed in the nativity.\\n\\n14. Occuring of a severe reproach or fault, increase of enemies, illness of \\n\\nkinsmen danger from thunder storms, lightning and illness caused by food, drink or \\n\\nindigestion, will be the likely effects to be experienced by the native, in the antar \\n\\ndasa of Rahu in the dasa of the Moon.\\n\\n15.  Taking   great   delight   in   making   gifts   and   other   magnificient   actions, \\n\\nconferment   of   honours   by   the   king,   meetings   with   friends,   acquisition   of   new \\n\\nclothes and ornaments, and enjoyment of all kinds of happiness, will be the likely \\n\\neffects to be derived by the native, In the antar dasa of Jupiter in the dasa of the \\n\\nMoon.\\n\\n16. Affliction with many kinds of diseases, illness of friend, son and wife \\n\\nand danger of a great calamity or death, will be the likely effects for the native, \\n\\nduring the antar dasa of Saturn in the dasa of the Moon.\\n\\n17.

(A)  Three   nakshatras   from  Aswini,   viz.  Aswini,   Bharani   and   Krittika \\n\\ncomprise of 12 quarters. Aries, Taurus, Gemini and Cancer are the four navamsa of \\n\\nAswini.   Leo,   Virgo,   Libra   and   Scorpio   will   be   the   four   navamsa   of   Bharani. \\n\\nSagittarius Capricorn, Aquarius and Pisces will be the four navamsas of Krittika. In \\n\\nthis order (Apasavya or Apradakhina order) divide the three nakshatras by the 12 \\n\\nnavamsas.\\n\\n(B) There will be 12 navamsa of three nakshatras from Rohini viz., Rohlni, \\n\\nMrigasira and Aridra counting them in reverse order from Scorpio i.e. Scorpio, \\n\\nLibra, Virgo, Leo, Cancer, Gemini, Taurus, Aries, Pisces, Aquarius, Capricorn and \\n\\nSagittarius, divide them by the 12 navamsas. Scorpio will be the navamsa of the \\n\\nfirst quarter of Rohini, Libra will be the navamsa of 2nd quarter of Rohini and so \\n\\non ultimately finding that in this order Sagittarius will be the navamsa of the fourth \\n\\nquarter of Aridra. (This is known as Savya—reverse, Apradakhina or anticlockwise \\n\\norder).\\n\\n2. These are the trends of nakshatras reckoned in their order (from Aswini) \\n\\nto   be   distinguished   as   Apasavya   and   Savya.   The   years   assigned   to   a   planet \\n\\nconstitute the dasa period of the sign owned by that planet. This is the peculiarity \\n\\nin the\\' Kalachakra system, say the wise.\\n\\n3. The Sun\\'s dasa period  is 5 years (Leo is the sign owned by the Sun, \\n\\ntherefore dasa period of Leo will be 5 years). The dasa period of the Moon is 21 \\n\\nyears (the dasa of Cancer owned by the Moon will be the same). The dasa of Mars \\n\\nwill be of 7 years (the dasa of Aries and Scorpio will be the same). The dasa of \\n\\nMercury will be 9 years (the dasa period of Gemini and Virgo owned by Mercury \\n\\nwill be the same). The dasa of Jupiter will be 10 years (the dasa of Sagittarius and \\n\\nPisces owned by Jupiter will be the same). The dasa of Venus will be of 16 years \\n\\n(the dasa period of Taurus and Libra owned by Venus will be the same). The dasa \\n\\nof Saturn will be of 4 years (the dasa period of Capricorn and Aquarius owned by \\n\\n209\\n\\n\\x0cSaturn will be the same). The effects of kalachakra dasa are to be declared on the \\n\\nbasis of the sign whose dasa be in progress and its lord.\\n\\n4. In this kalachakra system consisting of dasas. An tar dasas, etc., I shall \\n\\nnow expound the formula for the several nakshatra padas from Aswini onwards. \\n\\nEvery such formula consists of nine syllables indicating by their number (as per \\n\\nkatapayadi   memories)   the   particular   rasyapaharas   composing   the   dasa   of   the \\n\\nnakshatra   pada   under   consideration   and   consequently   by   total   life   period \\n\\nappertaining thereto by means of the years allotted to the several owners of the \\n\\nsigns.\\n\\n5. For those born in the first pada of Aswini the following will be the 9 dasas \\n\\n(1) Aries-Mars (2) Taurus-Venus (3) Gemini-Mercury (4) Cancer-Moon (5) Leo-\\n\\nSun,   (6)  Virgo-Mercury   (7)   Libra-Venus   (8)   Scorpio-Mars   and   (9)   Sagittarius-\\n\\nJupiter.\\n\\nFor those born in the 2nd pada of Aswini, the following will be the 9 dasas \\n\\n(1) Capricorn-Saturn (2) Aquarius-Saturn (3) Pisces-Jupiter (4) Scorpio-Mars (5) \\n\\nLibra-Venus (6)  Virgo-Mercury (7)  Cancer-Moon (8)  Leo-Sun and (9)  Gemini-\\n\\nMercury.\\n\\nFor those born in the third pada of Aswini, the 9 dasas will be as follows — \\n\\n(1)   Taurus-Venus   (2)   Aries-Mars   (3)   Pisces-Jupiter   (4)   Aquarius-Saturn   (5) \\n\\nCapricorn-Saturn (6) Sagittarius-Jupiter (7) Aries-Mars (8) Taurus-Venus and (9) \\n\\nGemini-Mercury.\\n\\nFor those born in the 4th pada of Aswlni the 9 dasas will be as follow (1) \\n\\nCancer-Moon (2) Leo-Sun (3) Virgo-Mercury (4) Libra-Venus (5) Scorpio-Mars \\n\\n(6)  Sagittarius-Jupiter   (7)  Capricorn-Saturn   (8)  Aquarius-Saturn  and  (9)   Pisces-\\n\\nJupiter.\\n\\n6. For those born in the first pada of Bharanl the 9 dasas will be as follow (1) \\n\\nScorpio-Mars (2) Libra-Venus (3) Virgo-Mercury (4) Cancer-Moon (5) Leo-Sun \\n\\n(6) Gemini-Mercury (7) Taurus-Venus (8) Aries-Mars and (9) Pisces-Jupiter.\\n\\nFor those born in the 2nd pada of Bharani, the 9 dasas will be as follow (1) \\n\\nAquarius-Saturn   (2)   Capricorn-Saturn   (3)   Sagittarius-Jupiter   (4)  Aries-Mars   (5) \\n\\n210\\n\\n\\x0cTaurus-Venus (6) Gemini-Mercury (7) Cancer-Moon (8) Leo-Sun and (9) Virgo-\\n\\nMercury.\\n\\nFor those born in the 3rd pada of Bharani, the 9 dasas will be (1) Libra-\\n\\nVenus (2) Scorpio-Mai\\'s (3) Sagittarius-Jupiter (4) Capricorn-Saturn (5) Aquarius-\\n\\nSaturn   (6)  Pisces-Jupiter   (7)  Scorpio-Mars  (8)  Libra-Venus  and  (9)  Sagittarius-\\n\\nJupiter.\\n\\nFor those born in 4th pada of Bharani the 9 dasas will be in the following \\n\\norder   (1)   Cancer-Moon   (2)   Leo-Sun   (3)   Gemini-Mercury   (4)  Taurus-Venus   (5) \\n\\nAries-Mars   (6)   Pisces-Jupiter   (7)  Aquarius-Saturn   (8)   Capricorn-Saturn   and  (9) \\n\\nSagittarius-Jupiter.\\n\\n7.   The   formula   for  Aswini   and   Bharani   are   described   above.   The   four \\n\\nformulas given for the four padas of Aswini will also respectively apply to the four \\n\\npadas   of   Krittika   in   the  Apasavya   pradakshina   triad.   Formulas   for   Rohini   and \\n\\nMrigasira in the Savya triad are stafed in the next two verses and the four formulas \\n\\ngiven for the four padas of Mrigasira should also be used again for the four padas \\n\\nof Aridra.\\n\\n8.

For the remaining 23 nakshatras (each has \\n\\nfour   padas)   the   order   of   their   dasas   will   be   the   same   as   for   the   above   four \\n\\nnakshatras as explained below:—\\n\\n(a) The order of the dasas of the four padas of Krittika. Punarvasu, Ashlesha, \\n\\nHasta, Swati, Moola, Uttarashada, Poorvabhadra and Revati will be the same as for \\n\\nAswini.\\n\\n(b)   The   order   of   the   dasas   of   the   four   padas   of   Pushyami,   Chittra, \\n\\nPoorvashada, Uttarabhadra will be the same as for Bharani.\\n\\n(c) The order of the dasas of the four padas of Magha, Visakha and Sravana \\n\\nwill be the same as for Rohinl.\\n\\n(d) The order of the dasas of the four padas of Aridra, Poorva-phalguni, \\n\\nUttaraphalguni, Anuradha, Jyestha, Dhanishta and Shatabhisha will be the same as \\n\\nfor Mrigasira.\\n\\n10. The initial Mahadasha of a life belongs to the lord of the sign owning the \\n\\n212\\n\\n\\x0cnakshatra pada occupied by the Moon at the time of birth, being so much of the \\n\\nsign Mahadasha as corresponds to the Ghatlkas that yet remain of the nakshatra \\n\\npada and the order of Mahadashas follows the natural order of the nakshatra pada \\n\\nreckoned from the aforesaid one. This is the opinion, say the sages, held by some \\n\\nlearneds in Astrology.\\n\\n11. There are number of formulas each composed of a number of mnemonic \\n\\nsyllables, refering to the several nakshatra padas beginning with the first pada of \\n\\nAswini and giving signs in a certain order. It is with reference to the order of sign \\n\\nin these formulas that the rasi Mahadashas of which a life is to consist should be \\n\\ndetermined. The Vakyakrama, men of one school say, should be adhered to.\\n\\n12. In the  order  of sign  Vakyakrama, the  function  at  the  end of  Cancer, \\n\\nScorpio and Pisces give rise to (1) Manduka gati, (2) Aswa or Turaga gati and (3) \\n\\nSimhavalokana respectively and the dasas of those intervals cause woeful effects.\\n\\n13. The sub-period of any of the planets constituting a Mahadasha is thus \\n\\nobtained. Find out the mnemonic syllable (out of the nine syllables) composing a \\n\\nformula whose sub-period is wanted and find out the owner of the sign signified by \\n\\nthat syllable. Multiply the number of years assigned to this planet by the number of \\n\\nyears fixed for the planet whose Mahadasha is under consideration and divide the \\n\\nproduct by the total of years constituting the entire Ayus of the formula chakra. The \\n\\nquotient in years etc., will represent the sub-period required.\\n\\n14. The total number of years indicated  by the  Sun  of nine mnemonical \\n\\nsyllables of any formula represent the number In years of Parama Ayus for that \\n\\nformula. Thus the Parama Ayus in years for the 12 Rasiamsas reckoned from Aries \\n\\nin an Apasavya Chakra will be 100, 85, 83, 86 repeated thrice while those for the \\n\\n12 Rasiamsas reckoned from Scorpio in a Savya Chakra will be the same but in the \\n\\nreverse order, that is 86, 83, 85 and 100 repeated thrice.\\n\\nUtpanna, Adhana and Kshema Mahadashas\\n\\n15.   Whatever   effects   have   been   declared   by   me   in   the   case   of   several \\n\\nMahadashas (dasas), the same should be stated by wise astrologer in the cases of \\n\\nthese dasas also.\\n\\n213\\n\\n\\x0c16. Which is the 5th nakshatra from the Janma nakshatra? The Mahadasha \\n\\ncoming   from   such   counting   is   known   as   Utpanna   Mahadasha.   Count   the   8th \\n\\nnakshatra   from   the   Janma   nakshatra.   The   Mahadasha   commencing   from   this \\n\\nnakshatra is known as Adhana dasa. Similarly the dasa commencing from the 4th \\n\\nnakshatra from the Janma nakshatra is known as Kshema dasa.\\n\\nIf all,  these  three  dasas  operate  at  the  same  time (year, month.etc.),  that \\n\\nperiod may cause the death of the native. The third dasa for the Alpayu class, the \\n\\n5th   dasa   for   the   Madhyayu   class   and   the   7th   dasa   for   Deerghayu   class   are \\n\\nconsidered as maraka dasas (death inflicting dasas).\\n\\nNisarga dasa\\n\\n17. The years of dasa allotted in Naisargika dasa to the various planets are as \\n\\nfollows—The   Moon   1  Year,   Mars   2  Years,   Mercury   9   years,  Venus   20   years, \\n\\nJupiter 18 years, the Sun 20 years, Saturn 50 years. According to Yavanas the \\n\\nLagna dasa Is included in the 50 years of Saturn dasa. This is not accepted by \\n\\nothers. A well placed planet in a nativity produces favourable effects while the \\n\\neffects of the one adversely placed will not be auspicious. The dasas play their part \\n\\nin the order given here according to the natural strength of the planets concerned.\\n\\nAmsa dasa\\n\\n18. Convert the rasi, degree and minutes into minutes. Divide that by 2400. \\n\\nThe   remainder   indicates   the  Ayush   kala.   yielded   by   the   planet.   Divide   these \\n\\nAyuskalas by 200. The quotient will represent the number of years. Multiply the \\n\\nremainder   by   12   and   divide   the   product   by   200.  The   quotient   =   months.  The \\n\\nremainder should be multiplied by 30 and the product should be divided by 200. \\n\\nQuotient = days. This is the view  of Satyacharya.  If a planet is in his sign of \\n\\nexaltation   or   retrograde   the   years,   months   and   days   yielded   by   him   should   be \\n\\ntrebled. If the planet be in his own navamsa, decanate or Vargottama the years, \\n\\nmonths and days yielded by him should be doubled. If the planet be in his sign of \\n\\ndebilitation   or   eclipsed,   the   years,   months   and   days   yielded   by   him   should   be \\n\\nreduced to half. But this procedure of reduction of the dasa period of eclipsed \\n\\nplanets does not apply to Venus and Saturn.\\n\\n214\\n\\n\\x0c19. When malefic planets occupy the 6 houses counted backwards from the \\n\\n12th, the whole, a half, a third, a fourth, a fifth and sixth respectively of their \\n\\nAyurdaya is lost. When benefic planets occupy such positions, the loss is half of \\n\\nthat incured in the case of malefic ones. When several planets are in a house, only \\n\\nthe strongest of them causes a reduction in Ayurdaya. All planets except Mars lose \\n\\na third of their Ayurdaya when in inimical houses. The number of years contributed \\n\\nby   the   Lagna   according   to   Satyacharya\\'s   view   corresponds   to   the   number   of \\n\\nnavamsas that have risen. Even if the Lagna be strong or of medium strength, the \\n\\nsame rule holds.\\n\\n20.  The   rule   of   Satyacharya   is   prefered   (to   that   laid   down   by   Maya   or \\n\\nJeevasarman).   But   some   make   the   process   inconsistent   and   unwarantable   by   a \\n\\nseries   of   multiplications.   The   dictim   of   Acharyas   (Satya   and   others)   is   the \\n\\nfollowing.\\n\\n(1) When several multiplications crop up, only one that is the niftiest, to be \\n\\ngone through.\\n\\nFor instance when a planet is in his own house, and in his exaltation and in \\n\\nretrograde   motion,   the  Ayurdaya   is   not   to   be   doubled   first   and   then   the   result \\n\\ntrebled and the second result further trebled. According to the rule, the Ayurdaya \\n\\nshould be trebled once for all.\\n\\n(2) Again, when there are several reductions applicable, only one, that the \\n\\ngreatest should be made.\\n\\nFor instance a planet may be in an inimical sign and may be eclipsed by the \\n\\nSun, it is enough if the reduction by half i.e. Astangata reduction be made.\\n\\n(this verse is from Brihat Jataka Chapter 13). \\n\\nPindayur Dam\\n\\n21. If the Sun and other planets are in their deep exaltation, the number \\n\\nPindayurdaya Year allotted them are as follows — The Sun 19, The Moon 25, \\n\\nMars 15, Mercury 12, Jupiter 15, Venus 21, and Saturn 20. All the  reductions \\n\\nshould be gone through as before. When a malefic planet is posited in the lagna, \\n\\ntake   only  the   degrees,  minutes  etc.,  indicating   the  lagna  leaving   out  the   signs. \\n\\n215\\n\\n\\x0cMultiply the total ayus by this and divide by 300. The whole Ayurdaya should be \\n\\nreduced by this result. If the  lagna be aspected  by a  benefic, the  period to  be \\n\\nreduced will be only half of the above result. So say those well versed in Ayurdaya \\n\\nsystem.\\n\\n22. In the Pindayurdaya system when Amsa (lagna navamsa) is stronger the \\n\\nlagna ayus (or lagna dasa) corresponds to the lagna navamsa. When lagna (sign) is \\n\\nstrong, the number of years for lagna corresponds to the number signified by the \\n\\nsign etc., counted frorn Aries and not the lagna navamsa.\\n\\n23. The years assigned to the several planets in verse 21 are to be adopted in \\n\\nfull when they are in exaltation. When a planet is in his point of debilitation, the \\n\\nperiod   assigned   to   him   is   reduced   by   half;   when   he   occupies   an   intermediate \\n\\nposition, the reduction is to be proportionate, say the wise.\\n\\n24.   The   Pindayurdaya   system   is   advocated   as   the   best   by   Manitha, \\n\\nChanakya, Maya and others. But Satyacharya has pronounced this method to be \\n\\nfaulty and Varahamihira has also made similar pronouncement.\\n\\n25.   Jeevasharma   lays   down   in   according   with   his   own   doctrine   that   the \\n\\nmaximum period of life given by each planet from the Sun onwards is 1/7th of the \\n\\nmaximum aggregate period (120 years and 5 days). In this Ayurdaya also all the \\n\\nreductions are enjoined. The lagna Ayur should be calculated in the same way as in \\n\\nthe other system.\\n\\n26. The full period of life in the case of men has been declared as 120 years \\n\\n(12 x 10) by some. There are others who have stated that the full period will be the \\n\\ntime taken by Saturn to make 3 complete revoluation (in his orbit). There is a third \\n\\nschool according to which the full life period of man is the time taken by the Moon \\n\\nfor making 1000 revolutions. But we are of the opinion that the full period of man\\'s \\n\\nlife in this kaliyuga is only 100 years as stated in the Vedas.\\n\\n27. Of the lagna. the Sun and the Moon whichever is strongest will have his \\n\\ndasa first. Then will come the dasa of the planet in kendra and other position. \\n\\nWhen several occupy any one these positions the preference will be given to the \\n\\nplanet who predominates in strength. When they happen to be equal in strength, \\n\\n216\\n\\n\\x0cthat who gives longer period, in years of Ayurdaya will have his turn first. When \\n\\nthere is equality even in regard to the number of years of Ayurdaya of the planets, \\n\\nthat who rises first after being eclipsed by the Sun, gets his dasa prior to others.\\n\\nIf   such   planets   should,   however,   chance   to   have   equal   strength,   equal \\n\\nAyurdaya and equal rising after their conjunction with the Sun. then the planet \\n\\nwhich   is   anterior   in   the   general   order   of   precedence   among   the   significations \\n\\nwould rule the dasa in question, and this general order of procedure is usually \\n\\ntaken to the (1) the lagna, (2) the Sun. (3) the Moon, (4) Mars, (5) Mercury, (6) \\n\\nJupiter, (7) Venus and (8) Saturn.\\n\\nAnd the strength of any planet for this purpose is obtained by multiplying \\n\\nhis   position   by   the   distance   of   the   planet   from   his   nearest   Bhava-Sahdhi   and \\n\\ndividing the product by the distance between the Bhavamsa and one of its Sandhis.\\n\\n28. Amsayurdaya is to be calculated upon the predominance in strength of \\n\\nthe   lagna.   Pindayurdaya   upon   the   Sun\\'s   superiority   in   strength   and \\n\\nNaisargikayurdaya when the Moon\\'s power is strongest. We shall now state what \\n\\nshould be done when the three (lagna, the Sun and the Moon) are of equal strength.\\n\\n29. Add the three Ayurdays and divide the sum by 3. The quotient will be the \\n\\nAyurdaya required. If only two of them are strong, add the two Ayurdayas and take \\n\\nhalf the result. When the three planets are all weak, adopt the method advocated by \\n\\nJeevasharma for finding out the Ayurdaya.\\n\\n30. Kalachkra dasa system has to be resorted to only when the lord of the \\n\\nnavamsa occupied by the Moon is strong. The dasa calculation as per nakshatra \\n\\nmethod is always considered as the best.\\n\\n31. The full period of life in the case of man and elephant is given as 120 \\n\\nyears and 5 days while in horses it is 32 years. It is 25 years in the case of asses \\n\\nand camels and 24 for bulls and buffaloes. Twelve years are allotted for dogs and \\n\\n16 years for sheep and like.\\n\\n32. This Ayus span of life has been declared by wise men with respect to \\n\\nonly those who are  engaged  in the practice  of various  actions, who keep their \\n\\nsenses under control, who eat wholesome diet, who are devoted to the Vedic class \\n\\n217\\n\\n\\x0cand the gods and who preserve the landmark of character and conduct peculiar to \\n\\ntheir high family.\\n\\nNotes — This chapter is based entirely on the translation of this chapter of \\n\\nPhaladeepika by Shri V. Subrahmanya Sastri.\\n\\nThus   ends   the   twenty   second   chapter   on   \"Kalachakra   Dasa   etc\"   in  \\n\\nPhaladeepika composed by Mantreswara.\\n\\n218\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 23\\n\\nAshtakavarga\\n\\nThe planets are always round the orbit influencing persons favourably and \\n\\nunfavourably. These influences are known as transit effects. Generally the transit \\n\\neffects are gauged from the sign in which the Moon is posited, for example, there \\n\\nis inauspicions effect of the transit of Jupiter in the 4th house and 6th house from \\n\\nthe Moon while his transit to the 5th house from the Moon produces auspicious \\n\\neffects.\\n\\nIn the consideration of transit effects the planet\\'s natal position remains the \\n\\nsame. It is only when the transit effects are to be ascertained their present position \\n\\nis taken into account. This information is available in Panchanga or Ephemeris. As \\n\\nhas been said ahove, it is usual to assess the transit effects of a planet from his \\n\\nposition from the Moon. The question arises as to whether Jupiter who gives evil \\n\\neffects from his position from the Moon but if Jupiter is well placed from the other \\n\\nplanets  in  the   natal   chart,   will  he  still   produce  the   same  evil  effects. Take  the \\n\\nreverse of it. Suppose that Jupter in his transit is at an auspicious place from the \\n\\nnatal Moon but is not in auspicious position from the natal Sun, Mars, Mercury, \\n\\nJupiter, Venus and Saturn and the Lagna. Will the Jupiter be treated as auspicious? \\n\\nThe intention of mentioning all this is that there is a system under which the effects \\n\\nof planets are ascertained by the position in transit not only from their position \\n\\nfrom the Moon but also with reference to the Lagna and all other planets with \\n\\nreferense to  their  placement  in the  natal chart.  This is called the  Ashtakavarga \\n\\nSystem.\\n\\nAshtaka means eight. These eight are the Lagna and the seven planets. The \\n\\nplanet which is in an auspicious position from more of the eight viz., Lagna and \\n\\nthe seven planets, should be considered beneficial in his effects.\\n\\n1. In order to ascertain the good and had effects by the several planets in \\n\\ntheir transit through the signs of the Zodiac, the Ashtakavarga system has been \\n\\nvery   highly   spoken   of   the   great   sages   and   I   now   set   forth   the   mode   of \\n\\n219\\n\\n\\x0caccomplishing it. Notes — The meaning of Ashtakavarga is literally the group of 8 \\n\\nthings. In other words, it is the combination of the good and bad positions of a \\n\\nplanet with respect to the 7 planets and the Lagna (8 things). So is the combination \\n\\nof benefic and malefic dots in a native\\'s chart with reference to these 8 planets \\n\\n(here Lagna is also treated as a planet).\\n\\n2. In the ancient times the Rasi chakra etc., were drawn on the ground and \\n\\nthe places where dots are to be indicated were shown by placing beads but now we \\n\\nuse pen and paper and dots are marked at the places where beads are to be placed. \\n\\nAlthough   in   the   verses   the   word   \\'beads\\'   has   been   used,   we   in   own  translation \\n\\nreplace \\'beads\\' with \\'dots\\' or bindus.\\n\\nDraw   a   horoscope   on   a   paper   and   place   the   all   seven   planets   at   their \\n\\nappropriate   positions.   Suppose   we   have   to   prepare  Ashtakavarga   chakra   of   the \\n\\nhoroscopoe given below. Rahu and Ketu being shadowy planets have no place in \\n\\nthe  Ashtakarvarga   chart.   First   we   will   describe   how   the   Sun\\'s  Ashtakavarga   is \\n\\nprepared.\\n\\nMOON\\n\\nSAT \\nRAHU\\n\\nL\\n\\nMERC\\n\\nSUN \\nVEN \\nMARS\\n\\nJUP \\nKETU\\n\\n220\\n\\n\\x0cThe Sun\\'s Ashtakavarga\\n\\n0\\n\\n000\\n\\n0000 \\n000\\n\\n0000\\n\\n00000\\n\\n000\\n\\n0000\\n\\n00000\\nL\\n\\n00000\\n\\n0000\\n\\n000\\n\\n3.   With   reference   to   Ashtakavarga   the   Sun   has   been   declared   highly \\n\\nauspicious in l-2-4-7-8-9-10-11 position from himself. Mark bindus in 3-2-4-7-8-9-\\n\\n10-11 places. The Sun is auspicious in 3-6-10-11 positions from the Moon, in 1-1-\\n\\n2-4-7-8-9-10-11   positions   from   Mars   and   Saturn,   in   5-6-9-11   positions   from \\n\\nJupiter,   in   6-7-12   positions   from   Venus,   in   6-9-10-11   and   12   positions   from \\n\\nMercury and in 3-4-6-10-11-12 from the Lagna. The other positions may be treated \\n\\nas inauspicious.\\n\\nBy marking bindu at the positions we will get the Sun\\'s Ashtakavarga. The \\n\\ntotal number of bindus is 48 detailed as under — From the Sun 8, from the Moon \\n\\n4, from Mars 8, from Mercury 7, from Jupiter 4, from Venus 3, from Saturn 8, and \\n\\nfrom the Lagna 6.\\n\\nMoon\\'s Ashtakavarga\\n\\n4. The Moon is auspicious in 3-6-7-8-10-11 positions from the Sun, in l-3-6-\\n\\n7-10-11 posiflons from herself, in 2-3-5-6-9-10-11 positions from Mars, in 3-4-5-\\n\\n7-8-10-11 positions from.

Saturn is benefic in 1-2-4-7-8-10-11 places from the Sun, in 3-6-11 places \\n\\nfrom the  Moon,  in  3-5-6-10-11-12   places  from  Mars,  in  6-8-9-10-11-12   places \\n\\nfrom Mercury, in 5-6-11-12 places from Jupiter, in 6-11-12 places from Venus, in \\n\\n224\\n\\n\\x0c3-5-6-11 places from himself and in 1-3-4-6-10-11 places from the Lagna.\\n\\nThus the total number of benefic bindus obtained by Saturn is 39 as detailed \\n\\nbelow :\\n\\nFrom the Sun 7, from the Moon 3, from Mars 6, from Mercury 6, from \\n\\nJupiter 4, from Venus 3, from himself 4 and from the Lagna 6.\\n\\nNote   -   In   the   above  Ashtakavargas   where   the   benefic   bindus   have   been \\n\\nmarked the planet will produce good effects while transiting the house concerned. \\n\\nIt will produce evil effects when transiting the houses without benefic Bindus. For \\n\\nexample, when Saturn in the course of his transit passes through 1-2-4-7-8-10-11 \\n\\nplaces from the Sun, he produces benefic effects. In the example horoscope, the \\n\\nSun is in Scorpio, therefore, from the Sun 1 Scorpio, 2 Sagittarius, 4 Aquarius, 7 \\n\\nTaurus, 8 Gemini. 10 Leo and 11 Virgo are favourable places for the transit of \\n\\nSaturn. He will not produce benefic effects while transiting other places viz, Aries, \\n\\nCancer, Libra, Capricorn and Pisces. The same should apply to the other planets \\n\\nincluding the Lagna. The number of benefic bindus has also its significance.\\n\\nThe planet will produce full benefic effects while passing through the house \\n\\nwith 8 benefic blndus. He will produce adverse effects where there are no benefic \\n\\nbindus. When there are four benefic blndus. In respect of four planets, the effects \\n\\nwill be benefic and in respect of the other four, the effects will be adverse (8th \\n\\ninclude   the  Ascendant).   In   the  Ashtakavarga   of   Saturn   shown   above,   there   are \\n\\nseven   benefic   blndus   In   Leo.   That   sign   proves   adverse   from   Venus   for   the \\n\\ntransiting Saturn. It will be seen from the example birth chart that Venus is in \\n\\nScorpio and from him the benefic places for Saturn are 6-11-12. Leo is 10th from \\n\\nScorpio. It is on this account in the Saturn\\'s Ashtakavarga he acquires 10 benefic \\n\\nbindus, as these are benefic dots for the transiting Saturn from the Sun, the Moon, \\n\\nMars,   Mercury,   Jupiter,   Saturn   and   the   Lagna.   Quite   good   results   will   accrue \\n\\nbecause of 7 bindus. The sign which contains only 1 benefic Bindu, the Saturn \\n\\nwhile in transit to that sign will produce very adverse effects. Medium effects may \\n\\nbe expected in case of 4 benefic bindus. Increasingly good effects may be expected \\n\\nwhen there are 4 or more benefic bindus and increasingly bad effects from signs \\n\\n225\\n\\n\\x0ccontaining less than 4 bindus.\\n\\n10. As explained in the notes above the planets produce good or bad effects \\n\\nas the case may be, which ever may preponderate in the Ashtakavarga calculations \\n\\nfrom the signs they occupy at the time of birth; but two things are to be kept in \\n\\nmind - (a) If a planet in course of transit passes through his own sign, his sign of \\n\\nexaltation, his friend\\'s sign or an upachaya house, he causes reduction in the evil \\n\\neffects and enhancement of the benefic effects.\\n\\nNotes — For example in course of his transit a planet in his own sign, sign \\n\\nof   exaltation,   friend\\'s   sign   or   upachaya   house,   which   contains   only   3   benefic \\n\\nbindus the bad effects will be substantially neutralised. If there be 5 benefic bindus, \\n\\nthe auspicious results will be enhanced.\\n\\n(b) If a planet in course of his transit passes through his sign of debilitation, \\n\\nenemy\\'s sign or Anupachaya, producing evil effects because of insufficient benefic \\n\\nbindus, these effects will  be enchanced by such a transit If there  are  adequate \\n\\nnumber of benefic bindus or more expected to produce good effects, these good \\n\\neffects will be reduced by such a transit.\\n\\n11. When all the Ashtakavargas have been prepared it should have been seen \\n\\nhow many bindus the various signs contain. The native may suffer loss of his life if \\n\\nthe particular planet in course of his transit passes through with no bindu. The \\n\\neffects according to the author in accordance with the number of bindus will be as \\n\\nunder :—\\n\\n1.  Bindu  Destruction or loss \\n2.  Bindus  Expenditure \\n3.  Bindus  Fear \\n4.  Bindus  Accomplishment of the desired \\n\\nobject \\n\\n5.  Bindus  Acquisition of a beautiful wife \\n6.  Bindus  Gain of wealth or property \\n7.  Bindus  Acquisition of a kingdom or high \\ngovernment position. \\n\\n12. The various signs occupied by the planets at the time of birth should be \\n\\ntreated as Lagnas and benefic bindus should be compounded in 8 ways due to the \\n\\n226\\n\\n\\x0ccountings by houses from the each of the seven planets and the Lagna and effects \\n\\nshould be assessed of the various houses counted from that planet on the basis of \\n\\nbindus they contain.\\n\\nNotes — For example  in  the  Sun\\'s Ashtakavarga, the  Sun  is in Scorpio. \\n\\nAccording to the author this should be treated as the Lagna as shown below:\\n\\nWhen the Sun in the course of his transit passes through a house containing \\n\\n4 or more bindus, benefic effects may be expected. Thus when the Sun transits \\n\\nTaurus which contains 7 bindus, excellent results will be produced in respect of \\n\\nthat house (which counted from the Sun will be the house of marriage conjugal life \\n\\netc.). There is only one bindu, in the house 5th from the Sun. The transit of the Sun \\n\\nto that house will cause trouble in respect of children, stomach, disorders, mental \\n\\nworry etc.\\n\\n0\\n\\n000\\n\\n0000 \\n000\\n\\n0000\\n\\n00000\\n\\n000\\n\\n0000\\n\\n00000\\n\\n0000\\n\\nL\\n00000\\n\\n0000\\n\\n000\\n\\n13. This verse explains as to when a planet will reduce good or bad effects \\n\\nof a house according to the number of bindus it contains.\\n\\nNote the sign and navamsa occupied by a planet at birth. When the planet in \\n\\nthe course of his transit passes through so much distance in that house, he produces \\n\\nthe effects of that house good or bad as the case may be.\\n\\nNote — For example in the example horoscope the longitude of Jupiter is 14 \\n\\ndegrees. In the Jupiter\\'s Ashtakavarga, Virgo centals 7 bindus. Jupiter in the course \\n\\nof his transit to Virgo will produce good effects due from the number of bindus \\n\\nwhen he has traversed 14 degrees in that sign.\\n\\n227\\n\\n\\x0c14. After the preparation of the Ashtakavarga of any planet, it should be seen \\n\\nwhich house contains the highest number of bindus and what house it is from the \\n\\nhouse occupied by the karaka planet which is to be treated as the Lagna or the first \\n\\nhouse. When a planet  — malefic or benefic in the course of his transit  passes \\n\\nthrough that house, he enchances its good effects. The reverse will be the case \\n\\nwhen the planet in the course of his transit passes through a house containing few \\n\\nor no benefic bindus.\\n\\n15. When a number of planets in course of their transits  pass through  a \\n\\nhouse containing a good number of benefic bindus in the Ashtakavarga of a planet, \\n\\nthey produce substantially good results of the house, the countig being reckoned \\n\\nfrom   the   house   occupied   by   the   karaka   planet   whose  Ashtakavarga   is   under \\n\\nconsideration. The previous verse gives the time of position of benefic bindus in a \\n\\nhouse. We give below the Prastar Ashtakavarga of Saturn\\n\\nAshatakavarga chakra of Saturn\\n\\nARS  TRS  GMN  CR  LEO  VRG  LBR  SCP  SAG  CAP  AQR  PSC \\n\\n0 \\n\\nSaturn \\nJupiter \\nMars \\nSun \\nVenus \\n0 \\nMercury   \\nMoon \\nLagna \\n\\n2 \\n\\n0 \\n\\n0 \\n\\n0 \\n3 \\n\\n0 \\n0 \\n0 \\n0 \\n0 \\n4 \\n\\n0 \\n0 \\n0 \\n0 \\n\\n0 \\n0 \\n0 \\n7 \\n\\n0 \\n0 \\n0 \\n0 \\n0 \\n0 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n0 \\n\\n1 \\n\\n0 \\n\\n0 \\n0 \\n\\n0 \\n4 \\n\\n0 \\n\\n0 \\n\\n0 \\n3 \\n\\n0 \\n\\n1 \\n\\n0 \\n\\n0 \\n0 \\n3 \\n\\n0 \\n0 \\n\\n0 \\n\\n0 \\n0 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n2 \\n\\nSaturn remains In a sign for 2 1/2 years. When will he produce his good or \\n\\nbad effects. One way to find out this has been given in verse.\\n\\n16-19. To ascertain the same draw a table of 96 squares and suppose we \\n\\nhave to find out the effects of Saturn\\'s transit, prepare a table for Saturn as given \\n\\nabove. It has been stated that in preparing Saturn\\'s Ashtakavarga benefic bindus \\n\\nwill fall in 1-2-4-7-10-11 house from the Sun. The Sun is in Scorpio, so from \\n\\nScorpio   the   1-2-4-7-10-11   houses   will   fall   in   Sagittarius,   Aquarius,   Taurus, \\n\\nGemini, Leo and Virgo. Put benefic bindus in these places. Similar benefic bindus \\n\\n228\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cshould be placed. Saturn Ashtakavarga has to be prepared in this manner.\\n\\nDivide   sign  into  8  divisions.   Each   division   will   be  of   3  degrees  and  45 \\n\\nminutes. Whatever be the sign the first division belongs to Saturn. Thus Saturn is \\n\\nthe lord of the first division of 3 degrees and 45 minutes. The 2nd, 3nd, 4th, 5th, \\n\\n6th 7th and 8th divisions are owned by Jupiter, Mars, the Sun, Venus, Mercury, the \\n\\nMoon and the Lagna. This is why in the above Saturn\\'s Ashtakavarga the order of \\n\\nplanets in the table is Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, the Sun, Venus, Mercury, the Moon \\n\\nand the  Lagna. It will  be seen that in  Leo there  are  benefic bindus of  Saturn, \\n\\nJupiter, Mars, the Sun, Mercury and the Lagna. When Saturn in the course of his \\n\\ntransit passes through these divisions, benefic effects will be produced. There will \\n\\nbe adverse effects when Saturn passes through the division of Venus because his \\n\\ndivision is deviod of benefic bindus\\n\\nThis is the sense of the verses 16-19.\\n\\n20. The Sarvashtakavarga containing the results of Ashtakavargas of all the \\n\\nplanets is prepared by putting in each sign the sum total of all the figures in the \\n\\nseven Ashtakavargas. If a sign contains figures exceeding 28, the results of the \\n\\ntransit in that sign will be auspicious. If the number of figures be less than 28, it \\n\\nshould be understood  that  effects of transit of planets in  the  sign will produce \\n\\ndanger or sorrow, the intensity of diversity being in proportion in the number.\\n\\nNotes — We would better clarify this how the sarvashtakavarga is prepared. \\n\\nIn accordance with the example the Ashtakavargas of the Seven planets, show the \\n\\nbenefic bindus as under:—\\n\\n1\\n\\n5\\n\\n3\\n\\n4\\n\\n3\\n\\n7\\n\\nThe Sun\\'s \\nAshtaka-\\nvarga\\n\\n4\\n\\n4\\n\\n4\\n\\n5\\n\\n3\\n\\n4\\n\\n5\\n\\nThe Moon\\'s \\nAshtaka-\\nvarga\\n\\n1\\n\\n4\\n\\n4\\n\\n6 L\\n\\n6\\n\\n3\\n\\n6\\n\\n3\\n\\n229\\n\\n\\x0c2\\n\\n3\\n\\n4\\n\\n2\\n\\n4\\n\\n4\\n\\nMars \\nAshtaka-\\nvarga\\n\\n2\\n\\n4\\n\\n3\\n\\n2\\n\\n5\\n\\n4\\n\\n4\\n\\n4\\n\\n4\\n\\n5\\n\\n4\\n\\n5\\n\\nMercury\\'s \\nAshtaka-\\nvarga\\n\\n4\\n\\n4\\n\\nL 5\\n\\n5\\n\\n4\\n\\n6\\n\\n3\\n\\n3\\n\\n5\\n\\n6\\n\\n3\\n\\n6\\n\\n4\\n\\n3\\n\\n2\\n\\n3\\n\\n3\\n\\n1\\n\\n5\\n\\n5\\n\\nJupiter\\'s \\nAshtaka-\\nvarga\\n\\n5\\n\\n4\\n\\n2\\n\\n3\\n\\nAshtaka-\\nvarga of \\nVenus\\n\\n4\\n\\n2\\n\\n5\\n\\n4\\n\\nSaturn\\'s \\nAshtaka-\\nvarga\\n\\n4\\n\\n4\\n\\n7\\n\\n7\\n\\n6\\n\\n5\\n\\n5L\\n\\n4\\n\\n3\\n\\n1\\n\\n7L\\n\\n3\\n\\n4\\n\\n6\\n\\n19\\n\\n26\\n\\n33\\n\\n28\\n\\n230\\n\\n\\x0c27\\n\\n29\\n\\n24\\n\\nSarvashta-\\nkavarga\\n\\n24\\n\\n40L\\n\\n25\\n\\n26\\n\\n36\\n\\n21. There are two principles laid down in this verse —\\n\\n(1) If in the auspicious houses reckoned from the Moon, there be more than \\n\\n28 benefic dots, such houses flourish, the houses are harmed if the benefic dots be \\n\\nless than 28.\\n\\n(2) Note which houses reckoned from the Moon are occupied by benefic \\n\\nplanets. If there be more than 28 benefic dots in such houses, their effects get \\n\\npromoted. The effects of the houses will cause damage if the benefic dots be less \\n\\nthan 28.\\n\\n22.   The   Ashtakavarga   figures   are   to   be   computed   according   to   rules \\n\\nprescribed in this chapter with respect to the positions of planets (existing) at the \\n\\ntime of birth of any person, is that particular rasi, month, hour etc. signified by the \\n\\nsign containing the greatest number of benefic dots, one ought to get performed \\n\\nanything auspicious when the planets concerned transit those houses.\\n\\n23. The effects of the house will be promoted even if it be occupied by a \\n\\nmalefic   if   such   a   planet   be   in   his   own   house.   If   a   planet   be   in   his   sign   of \\n\\ndebilitation or in his enemy\\'s house, the house occupied by him will be damaged.\\n\\n24.   If   a   benefic   planet   happens   to   own   a   dusthana   (6th,   8th,   12th)   will \\n\\ndestroy   the   house   occupied   by   him   even   if   he   may   be   occupying   his   sign   of \\n\\nexaltation. A malefic in exaltation will do good to the house occupied by him if he \\n\\nhappens to own good houses.\\n\\nThus   ends   the   twenty   third   chapter   on   \"Ashtakavarga\"   in   Phaladeepika  \\n\\ncomposed by Mantreswara.\\n\\n231\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 24\\n\\nEffects of Ashtakavarga according to Horasara\\n\\nNote   —   Horasara   is   a   recognised   work   on   Hindu  Astrology   written   by \\n\\nPrithuyasas,  son   of   Varahamlhira.   Its   English   translation   done   by   Mr.   R. \\n\\nSanthanam has been published by Ranjan Publications, the Publishers of this book.\\n\\n1. The 9th sign reckoned from the sign occupied by the Sun is called the \\n\\nhouse of lather. Multiply the benefic bindus in that house by the figure denoting \\n\\nthe Sodhyapinda\\n\\nNote — After the trikona and ekadhipatya reductions have been made in any \\n\\nAshtaka Varga, the sum-total of all the remaining figures is called the sodhyapinda \\n\\nin that Ashtakavarga (vide verse 3 infra).\\n\\n2. The figure so arrived at should be divided by 27. When Saturn passes \\n\\nthrough   the   nakshatra   represented   by   treat   figure,   in   course   of   his   transit, \\n\\nsomething untoward will happen to the father of the native.\\n\\n3. Or when Saturn in the course of his transit passes through the nakshatra in \\n\\ntrine to the nakshatra aforesaid, the death of the father or a similar elderly relation \\n\\nmay be expected. The sum-total of the figures remaining after the 2 reductions is \\n\\nknown a sodhyapinda.\\n\\n4. The death of the father takes place in the dasa of the lord of the navamsa \\n\\nin which the lord of the 4th house is posited. The same may happen to the father or \\n\\na similar elderly relative of the native in the dasa of the lord of the 4th house.\\n\\n5-6. Add 8 to the sodhyapinda  of the Sun\\'s Ashtakavarga and divide  the \\n\\nfigure so arrived at by 12. When the Sun passes in the course of his transit through \\n\\nthe sign represented by the remainder (counted from Aries) or its triangular sign, \\n\\nthe death of the father may be expected. A wise man should thus fix up with the \\n\\nhelptof all the other planets the demise in other cases.\\n\\n7. Multiply the number of benefic bindus in the sign 4th from the Moon. In \\n\\nthe   Ashtakavarga   of   the   Moon,   by   the   figure   of   the   sodhyapinda   in   the \\n\\nAshtakavarga of the Moon. Divide the product by 27. When Saturn in the course of \\n\\n232\\n\\n\\x0chis   transit   passes   through   the   nakshatra   represented   by   the   remainder  (counted \\n\\nfrom Aswini) or its triangular nakshatra, the death of the mother may be expected.\\n\\n8. Note the position in navamsas of the lords of the 4th and the 8th houses \\n\\nfrom the Moon. The death of the mother of the native takes place, when the Sun in \\n\\nthe course of his transit passes through a position triangular to those, the death of \\n\\nthe mother may be expected.\\n\\nNote the position of the navamsas of the lord of the 4th and the 8th houses \\n\\nfrom the Lagna. The death of the father takes place when the Sun in the course of \\n\\nhis transit passes through a position triangular to these navamsa signs.\\n\\n9. In the Ashtakavarga of Mars, note the number of benefic bindus in the \\n\\nsign 3rd to the sign occupied by Mars. The native will have the same number of \\n\\nbrothers.\\n\\nIn the Ashtakavarga of Mercury, note the number of benefic bindus in the \\n\\nhouse 4th to that occupied by Mercury. The native will have the same number of \\n\\nrelations or maternal uncles.\\n\\n10. In the Ashtakavarga of Jupiter, the number of children will be the same \\n\\nas the number of benefic bindus in the house 5th to that occupied by Jupiter. From \\n\\nthat   number   take   away   as   many   benefic   bindus   of   planets   as   are   occupying \\n\\ninimical or depression houses. The remainder will represent the number of children \\n\\nthe native may expect.\\n\\n11. In the Ashtakavarga of Jupiter add up all the benefic bindus remaining \\n\\nafter the trikona and ekadhipatya sodhana and from this sum deduct the number of \\n\\nbindus in the malefic signs. The number of the children the native will have will be \\n\\nrepresented by the remainder.\\n\\n12. In the Ashtakavarga of Venus note the sign containing the largest number \\n\\nof benefic bindus. If the wile of the native be born in the direction of the quarter \\n\\nindicated by that sign, increase of progeny through her is assumed. If the number \\n\\nof benefic bindus be meagre, wealth or progeny through her will be poor.\\n\\n13. In the Ashtakavarga of Saturn, multiply the sodhyapinda figure by the \\n\\nnumber of benefic bindus In the house 8th from the Lagna and divide the product \\n\\n233\\n\\n\\x0cby 27. The death of the native may be expected when Jupiter or Saturn In the \\n\\ncourse of his transit passes through the nakshatra (counted from Aswini) indicated \\n\\nby the remainder.\\n\\n14. In the Ashtakavarga of Saturn add up the number of benefic bindus in \\n\\nthe houses from the Lagna to that occupied by Saturn both Inclusive. In the same \\n\\nway   add   up   the   benefic   bindus   in   the   houses   from   Saturn   to   the   Lagna   both \\n\\nInclusive.   The   years   indicated   by   these   figures   will   bring   distress,   danger   or \\n\\ndisaster to the native.\\n\\n15. The figure Indicating the sodhyapinda In the Ashtakavarga of Saturn be \\n\\nmultiplied by the figure indicated by the number of benefic bindus in the 8th house \\n\\nform the Lagna. Divide the product by 27. The figure so arrived at will indicate \\n\\ntotal number of years of the longevity of the native. The time of death may be \\n\\ndetermined according to principles already described (see verse 13).\\n\\nTiikona sodhana\\n\\n16-17.   Note   —   Now   we   come   to   the   method   of   working   out   trikona \\n\\nsodhana. This, is an important part of the ashtakavarga scheme. Before we come to \\n\\nwhat Shri Mantreshwara has said about it, we will acquaint the readers with some \\n\\npoints which will facilitate the clear understanding of the trikona sodhana.\\n\\nAries, Leo and Sagittarius are triangular signs: The other triangular signs are \\n\\nAries, Virgo and Capricorn; Gemini. Libra and Aquarius and Cancer, Scorpio and \\n\\nPisces.\\n\\nWe have already described how the Ashtakavarga is prepared there are seven \\n\\nAshtakavargas viz., those of the Sun, the Moon, Mars. Mercury, Jupiter and Saturn. \\n\\nTrikona sodhana (rectification) is carried out in all the seven Ashtakavargas. For \\n\\nexample, if we have to carry out trikona sodhana of the Sun\\'s Ashtakavarga, we \\n\\nshould note the number of benefic bindus in all the three triangular signs — Aries, \\n\\nLeo and Sagittarius.\\n\\nThere are 3 benefic bindus in Aries, 5 in Leo and 4 in Sagittarius.\\n\\nThere is great difference of opinion amongst the ancient learneds about the \\n\\nmethod of trikona sodhana. They are given below:\\n\\n234\\n\\n\\x0c(1) The first view is that amongst the three signs deduct the figure of least \\n\\nnumber of bindus in a sign from the figures of bindus of the other two signs. In the \\n\\nSun\\'s Ashtakavarga Aries has 3 bindus, Leo 5 and Sagittarius 4. Amongst these \\n\\nthree signs Aries has the least number of bindus. Deduct this from the figures of \\n\\nLeo\\'s bindus viz., 5 i.e. 5-3=2. Similarly deduct 3 from 4 the figure of bindus of \\n\\nSagittarius, that is 4-3=1. In Aries there will be 3-3=0\\n\\nSimilarly in the next set of triangular signs Taurus, Virgo and Capricorn, \\n\\nTaurus has 7 bindus, Virgo 3 and Capricorn 3. Virgo and Capricorn has the least \\n\\nnumber   of   bindus.   Thus   as   result   of   trikona   sodhana   Taurus   will   have   7-3=4 \\n\\nbindus, Virgo 3-3=0 bindus and Capricorn 3-3=0 bindus.\\n\\nAs regards Gemini, Libra and Aquarius, Gemini has 4, Libra 4 and Aquarius \\n\\n6 in the Sun\\'s Ashtakavarga. Gemini and Libra have the least number of bindus. \\n\\nTherefore as a result of trikona sodhana Aquarius will have 5-4=1, Libra 4-4=0 and \\n\\nGemini 4-4 = 0 bindus.\\n\\nSARVASHTAKAVARGA\\n\\n3 \\nSun \\n4 \\nMoon \\nMars \\n4 \\nMercury  4 \\n5 \\nJupiter \\n4 \\nVenus \\n2 \\nSaturn \\n26 \\nTotal \\n\\n7 \\n5 \\n4 \\n5 \\n5 \\n3 \\n4 \\n33 \\n\\n4 \\n4 \\n2 \\n4 \\n4 \\n5 \\n1 \\n\\n4 \\n5 \\n48 \\n4 \\n1 \\n49 \\n3 \\n2 \\n39 \\n4 \\n5 \\n54 \\n4 \\n5 \\n56 \\n6 \\n4 \\n52 \\n39 \\n3 \\n3 \\n28  24  40  36  26  25  24  29  27  19  337 \\n\\n4 \\n3 \\n4 \\n4 \\n2 \\n5 \\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n6 \\n5 \\n5 \\n7 \\n5 \\n7 \\n\\n3 \\n6 \\n4 \\n4 \\n5 \\n4 \\n3 \\n\\n1 \\n4 \\n2 \\n4 \\n3 \\n3 \\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n6 \\n4 \\n6 \\n7 \\n4 \\n6 \\n\\n5 \\n3 \\n3 \\n4 \\n3 \\n6 \\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n3 \\n2 \\n5 \\n6 \\n3 \\n1 \\n\\nIn the fourth set of triangular signs in the the Sun\\'s Ashtakavarga, Cancer has \\n\\n4, Scorpio 5 and Pisces 1. Pisces has the Least number of bindus. Therefore as a \\n\\nresult of trikona sodhana. Cancer will be 4-1=3, Scorpio 5-1=4 and Pisces 1-1=0 \\n\\nbindus.\\n\\nThus the following principles are to be observed in trikona sodhana:—\\n\\n(a)   Of   the   three   triangular   signs,   the   figure   of   the   sign   having   the   least \\n\\nnumber of bindus, has to be deducted from the figures of all the signs and the \\n\\nremainder will represent the final rectified figure of the signs.\\n\\n235\\n\\n\\x0c(b) No change is necessary in the figures of the other signs if one of the \\n\\nsigns has 0 bindus.\\n\\n(e) If the figures of all the three signs are the same, then that figure should \\n\\nbe deducted from the feaures of all the seris, that result having been that all the \\n\\nsigns will have Zero as remainders.\\n\\nAbove view is that of Parasara. Now we give another view in regard to \\n\\ntrikona sodhana.\\n\\nSuppose we have to do trikona sodhana in the Sun\\'s Ashtakavarga. Aries has \\n\\n3 bindus, Leo 5 and Sagittarius 4. The smallest figure is 3. Therefore according to \\n\\nthis view the figures of all the three signs should be adopted as 3.\\n\\nTaurus has 7 bindus, Virgo 3 and Capricorn 3. 3 being the smallest figure, \\n\\nthis may be adopted for all the three signs.\\n\\nIn the Sun\\'s Ashtakavarga, Gemini has 4, Libra 4 and Aquarius 5. 4 should \\n\\nbe adopted for all these three signs.\\n\\nCancer has 4, Scorpio 5 and Pisces 1 bindus. Here the figure 1 should be \\n\\nadopted for all the three signs.\\n\\nThe above is the view of Shri Balabhadra as given in his book Hora Ratna.\\n\\nNow we give the view of Shri Mantreshwara as laid down in verses 16-17.\\n\\n(1) Of the three signs in a trikona group, find which sign contains the least \\n\\nnumber of benefic bindus. The figures in the other two sings should be reduced to \\n\\nthat extent. If there be no bindus in any sign, no such reduction will be necessary in \\n\\nthe other two signs of the triangular group.\\n\\n(2) If there be no bindus in two of the signs of a group, remove the figures in \\n\\nthe third. When all the three signs of a group have the same number of bindus, \\n\\nremove all.\\n\\nNotes — Here it will be relevant to quote the views of Jataka Parijat also (1) \\n\\nIn the Ashtakavarga of any one of the Sun and other planets take the signs by the \\n\\ntriangular   groups   (i)  Aries,   Leo,   Sagittarius,   (ii)   Taurus,   Virgo,   Capricorn   (iii) \\n\\nGemini, Libra, Aquarius and (iv) (Cancer, Scorpio and Pisces; and examine the \\n\\nbenefic bindus in the 3 signs composing any group. If in any one sign of a group, \\n\\n236\\n\\n\\x0cthe number of benefic bindus be less than that in each of the remaining two, or \\n\\nequal   to   that   in   each   of   the   other   two   or   be   zero,   the   same   will   have   to   be \\n\\nsubstracted from the number of benefic bindus in each of the three signs of the \\n\\ngroup chosen.\\n\\n(2) If a sign in a triangular group has the least number of bindus, the other \\n\\ntwo signs must have their benefic bindus altered into this least number. If a sign \\n\\nhas   no   benefic   bindus,   the   remaining   signs   of   the   same   group   will   keep   their \\n\\nfigures unaltered. If all the signs of a triangular group have the same number of \\n\\nbenefic bindus they must all be removed (i.e., replaced by zero).\\n\\nEkadhipatya Sodhana\\n\\n18. Ekadhipatya sodhana should be undertaken after carrying out the trikona \\n\\nsodhana. When both the houses owned by a planet contain benefic bindus, then \\n\\nonly this rectification would be called for.\\n\\n19. Of the two signs having a common lord, if one alone be occupied and \\n\\ncontain a less number of benefic bindus than the number in the other, the figure in \\n\\nthe latter is to be made equal to the former.\\n\\n20. If one of the two signs owned by the same planet be occupied and has \\n\\nmore benefic bindus than the other, remove the figure in the latter. If two signs \\n\\nonly one of which is occupied, contain the same number of benefic bindus, the \\n\\nfigure in the unoccupied sign should be removed.\\n\\n21. If both the signs owned by a planet be unoccupied and have the same \\n\\nnumber of benefic bindus, the figures of both should be removed. If both the signs \\n\\nowned by a planet, be occupied by planets, no rectification will be necessary.\\n\\n22. No rectification is called for if one of the two signs (whether occupied or \\n\\nunoccupied), contain no benefic dots. If both the signs be unoccupied and have an \\n\\nunequal number of benefic bindus the greater figure is to be replaced by the lesser \\n\\none.\\n\\n23.   The   net   figure   after   the   two   rectifications   in   the   several   signs   are \\n\\nrequired to be multiplied each into its sign factors (Rasi mana). The net figures in \\n\\nthe signs that are associated with the Sun and other planets are to be multiplied by \\n\\n237\\n\\n\\x0cthe appropriate planetary factors (or Grahamana).\\n\\nThe multipliers of the signs and planets 25. The multipliers of the various \\n\\nsigns are as under\\n\\nAries \\nTaurus \\nGemini \\nCancer \\nLeo \\nVirgo \\n\\n7 \\n10 \\n8 \\n4 \\n10 \\n5 \\n\\nLibra \\nScorpio \\nSagittarius \\nCapricorn \\nAquarius \\nPisces \\n\\n7 \\n8 \\n9 \\n5 \\n11 \\n12 \\n\\nThese are called sign or rasi multipliers. The multipliers in respect of the \\n\\nplanets are different.\\n\\n26. The multipliers of the various planets are as under:\\n\\n5 \\nSun \\n5 \\nMoon \\nMars \\n8 \\nMercury  5 \\n\\nJupiter \\nVenus \\nSaturn \\n\\n10 \\n7 \\n5 \\n\\nThe   multiplication   by   the   planet   or   Graha   factors   should   be   effected \\n\\nseparately and should be treated as distinct from the sign or rasi. Multiplication.\\n\\n27. After multiplying  and then  adding  the  two  products,  the total should \\n\\nagain be multiplied by 7 and divided by 27. The quotient obtained will be the Ayus \\n\\n(span of life) in years contributed by that planet.\\n\\n28. The  remainder  multiplied  by  12  and  divided  by   27  will  indicate   the \\n\\nmonths. The remaindec after this operation should be multiplied by 30 and divided \\n\\nby 27 to get the days and to get the Ghatikas etc., 27 years constitute a mandala \\n\\nSome reductions have to be made further.\\n\\n29-30. The period contributed by a planet has to be reduced as follows:\\n\\n(1) By half if the planet is in conjuction with another planet.\\n\\n(2) By half if the planet is in his sign of debilitation or combust.\\n\\n(3) By one third if the planet occupies an inimical sign\\n\\n238\\n\\n \\n \\n\\x0c(4)   By   one   third   if   the   planet   occupies   house   in   the   visible   half   of   the \\n\\nhorizon.\\n\\n(5) By one third if a planet gets defeated in planetary war or occupies a \\n\\nposition within the Pata range of the Sun and the Moon.\\n\\n31-32. When several  reductions have to be made in the case of a single \\n\\nplanet, only one and that the greatest should be made. All the figures should then \\n\\nbe added up and the sum total should be multiplied by 324.\\n\\nThe product should then be divided by 365. The quotient will be the correct \\n\\nrectified Ayus contributed severally by the planets and may be shown in years, \\n\\nmonths, days etc., and will be their dasa periods.\\n\\n33. The dasa periods of each of the serveral planets should be calculated in \\n\\nthis manner. According to the author the method of calculating the dasa periods by \\n\\nthe Ashtakavarga process is the best of all.\\n\\n34-35. In the sarvashtakavarga the figures indicating the number of benefic \\n\\nHindus in the 12 houses reckoned from —\\n\\n(1)  The Sun are 3,3,3,3,2,3,4,5,3,5,7,2  =  43 \\n(2)  The Moon 2,3,5,2,2,5,2,2,2,3,7,1  =  36 \\n=  49 \\n(3)  Mars 4,5,3,5,2,3,4,4,4,6,7.2 \\n=  46 \\n(4)  Mercury 3,1,5,2,6,6,1.2,5,5,7,3 \\n(5)  Jupiter 2.2,1,2,3,4,2,4,2,4,7,3 \\n=  36 \\n(6)  Venus 2,2,3,3,3,4,4,2,3,4,3,4,3,6,3  =  40 \\n=  42 \\n(7)  Saturn 3,2,4.4,4,3,3,4,4,4,6,1 \\n=  45 \\n(8)  Lagna 5,3,5,5,2.6,1,2,2,6,7,1 \\n=  537 \\nTotal Sarvashtakavarga figure \\n\\n36.   The   Ashtakavarga   system   considered   as   the   most   effective   for   all \\n\\nundertakings. There is no other way to determine the good or bad result of any of \\n\\nthe event at any time.\\n\\n37. The signs which have 30 or more benefic bindus always prove benefic. \\n\\nThe effect will be medium or benefic for bindus between 25 and 30. The houses \\n\\ncontaining less than 25 will cause misery.\\n\\n38. The native will acquire wealth and will be happy if in his nativity, the \\n\\nnumber of benefic bindus in the 11th house of the sarvashtaka-varga exceeds the \\n\\n239\\n\\n \\n\\x0cnumber of bindus in the 10th house and the figure in the 12th less than that of the \\n\\n11th, and the figure in the lagna more than that of the 12th.\\n\\n39. In whichever houses from the lagna to the 12th house the number of \\n\\nbenefic bindus are more, good results may be expected in the course of the transits, \\n\\nwhen the number is less, only adverse effects will come to pass.\\n\\n40.   The   principle   laid   down   in   the   previous   verse   is   applicable   only   to \\n\\nhouses   other   than   the   6th,   the   8th   and   the   12th.  All   auspicious   functions   and \\n\\nceremonies   should   be   performed   during   the   transits   through   the   signs   which \\n\\ncontain greater number of benefic bindus\\n\\n41-42 The figures in the houses reckoned from the Lagna to Saturn, both \\n\\ninclusive, should be added up and the figure so arrived at, be multiplied by 7 and \\n\\nthe product be divided by 27.\\n\\nThe native will suffer from some calamity or disease in the year signified by \\n\\nthe quotient. The same process may be adopted in regard to the houses reckoned \\n\\nfrom Saturn to the Lagna. This principle would also apply to Mars and Rahu and \\n\\nthe years worked out by the method indicated above will bring adverse events for \\n\\nthe native.\\n\\n43. The year indicated by the figure obtained by (1) adding the number of \\n\\nbenefic bindus in the houses occupied by benefic planets and (2) then multiplying \\n\\nthe same by 7 and (3) dividing the product by 27, will be the year when auspicious \\n\\nevents will take place, such as, acquiring of issues, wealth and happiness.\\n\\n44. In  this  verse  the   author   concludes  to   say   that  in   this  chapter  he  has \\n\\ndescribed the effects due to Ashtakavarga. The same have been treated in greater \\n\\ndetail in other works by the learneds in this divine science.\\n\\nNotes—Readers are advised to refer to Brihat Parasara Hora Shastra and \\n\\nJataka Parijata published by Ranjan Publications.\\n\\n240\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 25\\n\\nCalculation of the positions of Gulika\\n\\nand other Upagrahas and their effects\\n\\n1. The author in this verse pays obeisance to all the upgrahas viz., (1) Mandi \\n\\n(Gulika), (2) Yamakantaka. (3) Ardhaprahara, (4) Kala, (5) Dhooma, (6) Patha or \\n\\nVyatlpatl, (7) Parldhi, (8) Indra Dhanus and (9) Ketu or Upketu.\\n\\n2. When the duration of the day is 30 ghatikas, the positions of Mandi or \\n\\nGulika on the week days counting from Sunday onwards is at the end of 26, 22, 18, \\n\\n14, 10, 6, 2 ghatikasa (from Sunrise) during day time. These figures have to be \\n\\nproportionately   increased   or   diminished   according   to   the   duration   of   the   day \\n\\nchosen is greater or less than 30 ghatikas. At night (from Sunset) the positions of \\n\\nthe lord of the seven muhurtas are counted not from the lord of the week day \\n\\nchosen; but that of the 5th. The position of mandi at night will be different on the \\n\\nweek days viz., at the end of 10, 6, 2, 26, 22, 18 and 14 respectively.\\n\\n3. The position of Yamakantaka during day time on week days is at the end \\n\\nof ghatikas 18, 14,10. 6, 2, 26 and 22; of Ardhapranara, at the end of Ghatikas 14, \\n\\n10, 6, 2, 26, 22 and 18.\\n\\n4. The position of Kala on the week days counting from Sunday onwards is \\n\\nat the end of Ghatikas 2, 26. 22, 13, 14, 10 and 6, respectively during day time. \\n\\nThese figures have, as already stated for Mandi, to be proportionately changed and \\n\\ntheir exact positions fixed as in the case of Lagna.\\n\\n5. The position of Dhuma is ascertained by adding 4 signs, 13° and 20\\' to the \\n\\nlongitude of the Sun. The position of Vyatlpata will be found if the longitude of \\n\\nDhuma is substracted from 12 signs. The position of Paridhi (or Parivesha) can be \\n\\nfound by adding 6 signs to the figure of Vyatipata. The position of Indra Dhanus \\n\\n(or Indra Chapti) is calculated by substracting longitude of Paridhi from 12 signs. \\n\\nThe position of Upaketu is to be found out by adding 16 degrees and 40 minutes to \\n\\nthe figure of Indra Dhanus. Upaketu increased by one sign wil give the longitude \\n\\nof the Sun.\\n\\n241\\n\\n\\x0cNotes — We will illustrate the above by giving an example:\\n\\n(1)  Sun add \\n\\n7-26 +\\n4-13-20\\n0-9-20 \\n12-0-0 - \\n0-9-20\\n11-20-40 \\n(3)  Vyatipata + 6 signs  11-20-40 \\n\\n(2)  Subtract the figure \\nof Dhuma from 12 \\nsigns \\n\\n(4)  Deduct Paridhi \\n\\nfrom 12 signs \\n\\n(5)  Add 16°-40\\' to \\n\\nIndia Dhanus \\nAdd 1 sign to \\nUpaketu \\n\\n6-0-0\\n5-20-40 \\n12-0-0 - \\n5-20-40\\n6-9-20 \\n+ 16-40\\n6-26-0 \\n+ l-00-0 \\n\\nDhuma \\n\\nVyatipata \\n\\nParidhi \\n\\nIndra \\nDhanus \\n\\nUpaketu \\n\\n7-26-0 \\n\\nSun \\n\\n6. In the chapter on \\'houses\\' the effects of these have already been described \\n\\nin a collective manner. It is only the effects on the houses of those that have been \\n\\nleft out there, will be described here in detail.\\n\\n7. Nevertheless, some special effects of Gulika (Mandi) and other Upagrahas \\n\\nwhich have been described by the ancient learneds, are enumerated here iri brief.\\n\\n8. If Gulika be in the Lagna, the native will be a thief, cruel and devoid of \\n\\npoliteness. He will not be very fat. He will have defects in his eyes. He will have \\n\\nfew issues and little intelligence. He will not take interest in the study of Vedas and \\n\\nShastras. He will eat much but will be unhappy . He does not live long. He will be \\n\\nof angry temperament, stupid and a coward. He will be lustful and deprived.\\n\\n9. If Gulika be in the 2nd house, the native will not have a pleasant manner \\n\\nof speech. He will be quarrelsome and will ever remain short of wealth and grain. \\n\\nHe will mostly live away from his native place. He will not stick to his word and \\n\\nwill be incapable of discussing things in which the use of intellect is necessary.\\n\\n10. If Gulika be in the 3rd house, the native will be greedy and voitable. He \\n\\nwill generally like to lead a lonely life. He will be very fond of liquors. He will get \\n\\nlittle happiness from brothers and sisters.\\n\\n242\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cHe will  be fearless  and devoid  of  sorrow. He  exhibits  ostentation  in  the \\n\\nacquistion of wealth.\\n\\n11. If Gulika be In the 4th house, the native will be without relations and \\n\\nwealth. He is deprived of comforts of conveyances.\\n\\nIf Gulika be in the 5th house, the native will be badly disposed and fickle \\n\\nminded. He will be short lived.\\n\\nIf Gulika be in the 6th house, the native takes interest in demonology. He \\n\\nwill   be   brave   and   will   vanquish   his   enemies.   He   will   be   blessed   with   a   son \\n\\npossessing good qualities.\\n\\n12. If Gulika be in the 7th house, the native will be quarrelsome and a public \\n\\nenemy. He will be dull minded, some what of angry temperament and ungrateful. \\n\\nHe will have many wives.\\n\\n13. If Gulika be in the 8th house, the native will be short statured.\\n\\nHe will have a deformed face and impaired eyes.\\n\\nIf Gulika be in the 9th house the native will be devoid of elderly relations or \\n\\npreceptor and children.\\n\\nIf Gulika be in the 10th house, the native does not perform auspicious or \\n\\ngood deeds and will not be charitable.\\n\\nIf   Gulika   be   in   the   11th   house,   the   native   will   be   happy,   powerful   and \\n\\nlustreful. He will also be blessed with children.\\n\\n14. If Gulika be in the 12th house the native will have no liking for sexual \\n\\npleasures. He will be poor and incur heavy expenditure.\\n\\nThe Janma Lagna or Janma Rasi of the native will be a sign that is triangular \\n\\nto that occupied by Gulika or the navamsa indentical with the one occupied by \\n\\nMandi.\\n\\n15. If Gulika be associated with the Sun, The native will have a father who \\n\\nwill be the cause of the death of his father. If Gulika be with the Moon, the mother \\n\\nof the native will be in distress. If Gulika be with Mars, the native will be separated \\n\\nfrom his brothers. If Gulika be with Mercury, the native will become insane.\\n\\n16. If Gulika be conjoined with Jupiter, the native will be a blasphemous \\n\\n243\\n\\n\\x0cheretic.\\n\\nIf Gulika be associated with Venus, the native will enjoy the company of low \\n\\nclass women.\\n\\nIf Gulika be with Saturn the native will be afflicted with leprosy and will be \\n\\nshort lived.\\n\\n17. If Gulika be with Rahu, the native will suffer from a disease caused by \\n\\npoison.\\n\\nIf Gulika be with Ketu the native will meet with a fine accident.\\n\\nIf Gulika\\'s time on any week day be synchronous with the Tyajykala on the \\n\\nthat day, the person born then, though a king will become a begger.\\n\\n18.   The   association   of   Gulika   always   causes   evil   effects.   Wherever \\n\\nYamakantaka is associated good has to be expected.\\n\\n19. White Gulika is very powerful in causing evil, Yamakantaka is powerful \\n\\nin causing good. All the other upagrahas possess only half the power that Mandi \\n\\nhas in causing evil.\\n\\n20. In producing effects Gulkia is similar to Saturn, Yamakantaka is like \\n\\nJupiter. Ardhaprahara acts like Mercury and Kala is like Rahu.\\n\\n21. Kala\\'s effects will  be just like Rahu, while  Gulika is likely  to  cause \\n\\ndeath, Yamakantaka will produce beneficial results. Ardhaprahara\\'s effects will be \\n\\ngood if it is posited in a house with many benefic bindus. Its effects will be bad if it \\n\\noccupies an inauspicious house.\\n\\n22.  According   to   Parasara   if   the   other   houses   along   with   their   lords   be \\n\\nconjoined with Dhuma and other upagrahas, these houses will be destroyed.\\n\\n23. Dhuma will always cause trouble from heat, danger from fire and mental \\n\\nagony. Yamakantaka in the same position will cause danger from horned animals \\n\\nor death through qudrupeds.\\n\\n24. Paridhi or parvesh will create fear of water and the native will suffer \\n\\nfrom   watery   diseases.   He   will   suffer   from   imprisonment.   Indrachapa   or   Indra \\n\\nDhanus will get the native hit by a stone and wounded by weapons. He will also \\n\\nsuffer humiliation.\\n\\n244\\n\\n\\x0c25.   Ketu   or   Upaketu   will   cause   hit,   a   fall   etc.,   and   loss   in   the   native\\'s \\n\\nbusiness. He will also be in danger from thunder.\\n\\nThe effects described above will be denried during the dasa period of the \\n\\nplanet owning the house occupied by the upagraha.\\n\\n26. The effects of Upaketu in the 12 houses from Lagna will respectively be \\n\\n(1) short life, (2) ugliness, (3) valour, (4) unhappiness and distress, (5) loss of \\n\\nissues, (6) disturbance of the mind caused by enemies, (7) decay of sexual power, \\n\\n(8) loss of life by indulgence in sinful activities, (9) opposition to virtuous life, (10) \\n\\nwanderings, (11) gains and (12) committing faults.\\n\\n27. The five upagrahas Dhuma etc., traverse the sky are not visible. If at any \\n\\ntime they are visible any where they foreshadow evil to the world.\\n\\n28. Some say that Dhuma resembles the shape of fume clouds, while others \\n\\nhave described it as a star having a tail. Vyatipata is like the fall of a meteor and \\n\\nParvesha or Paridhi is a halo or disc round the Sun or the Moon.\\n\\n29. Indra Dhanus is the well known rainbow that is generally seen in the sky \\n\\nduring the advent of rain. Ketu is Dhumaketu causes calamity to the world.\\n\\n30. If the lord of the house occupied by Gullka be endowed with strength \\n\\nand occupies a kendra, a trikona, his own house or his sign of exaltation or a \\n\\nfriendly house, the native will enjoy extremely favourable results. He will own \\n\\nchariots (good conveyances), elephants and horses, will be as beautiful as cupid, \\n\\nwill be held in great esteem, will be very famous and will rule the world.\\n\\nThus   ends   the   twenty   fifth   chapter   on   \"Upagrahas\"   in   Phaladeepika  \\n\\ncomposed by Mantreswara.\\n\\n245\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 26\\n\\nEffects of transits of the various planets and constellations\\n\\n1. Among all the Lagnas, the Moon\\'s Lagna (Chandra Lagna or the sign in \\n\\nwhich the Moon is posited), is most important for assessing the effects of transits \\n\\n(Gocharaphalam). It is, therefore, imperative to make predictions about effects of \\n\\nthe transits of planets through various signs from the sign occupied by the Moon.\\n\\n2.  The   various   planets   give   results   while   transiting   the   following   places \\n\\ncounted from the Moon.\\n\\nThe Sun - the 3rd, 6th, 10th and 11th.\\n\\nThe Moon - the 1st, 3rd. 6th, 7th, 10th and 11th.\\n\\nMars - 3rd, 6th and 11th.\\n\\nMercury- 2nd. 4th, 6th, 8th, 10th and llth.\\n\\nJupiter - 2nd, 5th, 7th. 9th and 11th.\\n\\nVenus - 1st, 2nd. 3rd. 4th, 5th, 8th, 9th, 11th and 12th.\\n\\nSaturn - 3rd, 6th and llth.\\n\\nRahu - 3rd. 6th. 10th and 11th.\\n\\nKatu - 3rd. 6th, 10th and 11th.\\n\\n3. In the course of his transit the Sun is auspicious in 11th, 3rd, 10th and 6th \\n\\nif   at   that   the   corresponding   Vedha   place   namely   the   5th,   9th,   4th   and   12th \\n\\nrespectively are not affected by the transit of any of the planets except Saturn.\\n\\n4. The auspicious house for the Moon while in transit are the 1st, 3rd, 6th, \\n\\n7th, 10th and 11th. The Vedha houses respectively are the 5th, 9th, 12th, 2nd, 4th \\n\\nand 8th. In this case the effect will not be marked if Mercury should transit at that \\n\\ntime the corresponding Vedha place.\\n\\n5. The auspicious houses for Mars while in transit are the 3rd, 6th and 11th, \\n\\nand the corresponding Vedha houses are respectively the 12th, 9th and 5th. The \\n\\nsame applies to Saturn, but in this case the effect will not be marred if the Sun \\n\\nshould transit at the time of corresponding Vedha places.\\n\\n6. The auspicious houses for Mercury while in transit are the 2nd, 4th, 6th, \\n\\n246\\n\\n\\x0c8th, 10th and 11th. The corresponding Vedha houses are respectively the 5th, 3rd, \\n\\n9th, 8th and 12th. In the case of Mercury the effect will not be marred if the Moon \\n\\nshould transit at the time the corresponding Vedha places.\\n\\n7. During his transit in the 2nd, 11th, 9th, 5th and 7th Jupiter is good if the \\n\\ncorresponding  Vedha   places   viz.,   the   12th,   8th,   10th,   4th   and   3rd   are   without \\n\\nplanets.\\n\\n8. During his transit in the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 8th, 12th, and 11th, Venus will \\n\\nproduce auspicious effects if the corresponding Vedha places viz., the 8th, 7th, 1st, \\n\\n10th, 9th, 5th, llth, 6th and 3rd respectively are without planets.\\n\\n9-11.   When   the   Sun   transits   through   the   sign   occupied   by   the   Moon \\n\\n(Chandra Lagna) the native will suffer from fatigue and loss of wealth. He will \\n\\nbecome short tempered and will be sick. He will perform journey which will tire \\n\\nhim. The effects of the Sun\\'s transits through the other houses from the Moon will \\n\\nbe as follows :-\\n\\n1st - wearisome journey, fatigue, diseases.\\n\\n2nd - Loos of wealth, unhappiness, obstinacy andvictim of deceit by others.\\n\\n3rd - Acquistion of a new position, gain of wealth, happiness, freedom from \\n\\ndiseases and destruction of enemies.\\n\\n4th - Diseases, impediments to sexual enjoyments.\\n\\n5th - Mental anguish, ill health, humiliation in all possible ways.\\n\\n6th - Freedom from diseases, destruction of enemies, removal of sorrows \\n\\nand anxieties.\\n\\n7th   -   Wearisome   jorneys,   stomach   disorders,   trouble   in   the   anus   and \\n\\nsuffering humiliation.\\n\\n8th  - Fear, diseases, quarrels,  royal  displeasure, suffering  from excessive \\n\\nheat.\\n\\n9th   -   Danger,   humiliation,   separation   from   close   relations   and   mental \\n\\ndepression.\\n\\n10th - Success in a great and important undertaking.\\n\\n11th - New position, honour, wealth and freedom from diseases.\\n\\n247\\n\\n\\x0c12th - Sorrow, toss of wealth, quarrels with friends and fever.\\n\\n12. The Moon\\'s transit through the various houses reckoned from the Moon \\n\\nwill yield the following effects:—\\n\\n1st - Dawn of fortune\\n\\n2nd - Loss of wealth\\n\\n3rd - Success\\n\\n4th - Fear\\n\\n5th - Sorrow\\n\\n6th - Freedom from diseases\\n\\n7th - Happiness\\n\\n8th - Unhappy and troublesome events.\\n\\n9th - Sickness\\n\\n10th - Fulfilment of ambitions\\n\\n11th – Joy\\n\\n12th - Expenditure.\\n\\n13-16. The following effects will be realised from Mars\\' transit through the \\n\\nvarious houses reckoned from the Moon:-\\n\\n1st - Mental Depression, separation from relations and diseases caused by \\n\\nimpurity of blood, bile and heat.\\n\\n2nd - Fear, exchange of hot words and loss, of wealth.\\n\\n3rd   -   Success   in   all   undertakings,   acquistiorj   of   gold   ornaments   and, \\n\\nhappiness caused thereby.\\n\\n4th - Loss of position, stomach disorders and sorrow through relations.\\n\\n5th - Fever, unnecessary desires, mental agony through son, quarrel with \\n\\nrelations. .\\n\\n6th   -   End   of   strife   and   withdrawal   of   enemies,   freedom   from   diseases, \\n\\nvictory, gain of wealth and success in all undertakings.\\n\\n7th - Misunderstanding with wife, eye diseases, stomach-ache and similar \\n\\ndisorders.\\n\\n8th - Fever, anaemia, loss of wealth and honour.\\n\\n248\\n\\n\\x0c9th - Humiliation through of wealth, difficulty in walking due to weakness \\n\\nand wastage in the several constituent elements of body.\\n\\n10th - Misbehaviour, failure in efforts and exhaustion.\\n\\n11th   -   Gain   of   wealth,   freedom   from   diseases   and   increase   in   landed \\n\\nproperty.\\n\\n12th - Loss of wealth, sickness caused by exessive heat.\\n\\n17. The following effects will be realised by the passage fo Mercury through \\n\\nthe various houses reckoned from the Moon:-\\n\\n1st - Loss of wealth\\n\\n2nd - Gain of wealth\\n\\n3rd - Fear from enemies\\n\\n4th - Accrual of wealth\\n\\n5th - Quarrel with wife and children\\n\\n6th - Success\\n\\n7th - Misunderstandings\\n\\n8th - Gain of wealth and birth of children\\n\\n9th - Destruction in undertakings\\n\\n10th - Happiness all round\\n\\n11th - Increase in prosperity\\n\\n12th - Fear of humiliation.\\n\\n18-20   The   effects   of   the   transit   of   Jupiter   through   the   various   houses \\n\\nreckoned from the Moon will be as given below:-\\n\\n1st - Departure Irom the native place, heavy expenditure and ill will towards \\n\\nothers.\\n\\n2nd - Acquisition of wealth, domestic happiness and influence over others.\\n\\n3rd - Loss of position, separation from friends, obstacles in business and \\n\\ndiseases.\\n\\n4th - Sorrow through relations, humiliation and danger from quadrupeds.\\n\\n5th - Birth of children, association with noble persons and royal favour.\\n\\n6th - Trouble from enemies and cousins and diseases.\\n\\n249\\n\\n\\x0c7th - Journey for an auspicious work, happiness with wife and acquisition of \\n\\nchildren.\\n\\n8th   -Tiresome   journeys   resulting   in   fatigue,   unlucky,   misery   and   loss   of \\n\\nwealth.\\n\\n9th - Prosperity all round.\\n\\n10th - Danger to property, position and children.\\n\\n11th - Birth of children, gain of new position and honour.\\n\\n12th - Grief, fear caused through property.\\n\\n21. The effects of the transit of Venus through the various houses reckoned \\n\\nfrom the Moon be as follows: -\\n\\n1st - Conferment of all kinds of enjoyments.\\n\\n2nd - Gain of wealth.\\n\\n3rd - Prosperity.\\n\\n4th - Increase in happiness and friends.\\n\\n5th - Birth of children.\\n\\n6th - Accidents.\\n\\n7th - Trouble to wife.\\n\\n8th - Acqusition of wealth.\\n\\n9th - Happiness.\\n\\n10th - Quarrels.\\n\\n11th - Safety.\\n\\n12th - Acquisition of wealth.\\n\\n22-23. Saturn in his passage through the various houses reckoned from the \\n\\nMoon, will produce the following effects :—\\n\\n1st - Diseases and performance of funeral rites.\\n\\n2nd - Loss of wealth and children.\\n\\n3rd - Gain of position or employment and acqusition of wealth and servants.\\n\\n4th - Loss of wife, relations and wealth.\\n\\n5th - Diminishing of wealth, loss of children and confusion of mind.\\n\\n6th - Happiness all round.\\n\\n250\\n\\n\\x0c7th - Suffering to wife and danger during journeys.\\n\\n8th   -   Loss   of   children,   cattle,   friends   and   wealth,   and   suffering   from \\n\\ndiseases.\\n\\n9th - Loss of wealth, obstacles to the performance of good deeds, death of an \\n\\nelderly relative equal to father and perpetual sorrow.\\n\\n10th   -   Indulgence   in   sinful   actions,   loss   of   honour   and   suffering   from \\n\\ndiseases.\\n\\n11th - All kinds of happiness, gain of wealth and receipt of unique honour.\\n\\n12th - Engagement in a business bringing no gains, loss of wealth through \\n\\nenemies, and sickness to wife and son.\\n\\n24. Rahu in the course of his passage through the various houses will cause \\n\\nthe following effects :—\\n\\n1st - Sickness or death. 2nd - Loss of wealth. 3rd - Happiness. 4th - Sorrow. \\n\\n5th - Financial loss. 6th – Happiness. 7th - Losses (of wealth). 8th - Danger to life. \\n\\n9th   -   Losses   (of   wealth).   10th   -   Gains   (of   wealth).   11th   -   Happiness.   12th   - \\n\\nExpenditure.\\n\\nNote:—The author has not given the effects of the transit of Ketu. Probably \\n\\nthey will be the same as those of Rahu.\\n\\n30. Mars and the Sun produce effects (during their transit) when they are in \\n\\nthe first 10 degrees or first decanate of a sign. Jupiter and Venus are effective in \\n\\nmiddle position of a sign (2nd decanate) while the Moon and Saturn become alive \\n\\nwhen   in   the   last   position.   Mercury   and   Rahu   produce   effects   throughout   their \\n\\npassage.\\n\\nThe transit of Nakshatras Saptashalaka\\n\\n26. Draw seven lines horizontally (from West to East) and over them draw \\n\\nseven lines vertically. The 28 extremities or points reckoned from the north-east \\n\\nare to be ascribed to the 28 stars (including Abhijit) counted from Krittika  (as \\n\\nshown in the diagram below :—\\n\\n251\\n\\n\\x0cIf the star occupied by the Sun at the time happens to be the Vedha star to \\n\\nthe natal star, there will be apprehension of danger to life; if the Adhana Nakshatra \\n\\n(19th   from   the   Janma   Nakshatra),   there   will   be   fear   and   anxiety;   if   to   the \\n\\nKharmaksha   (10th   from   the   Janma   Nakshatra).   loss   of   wealth   will   take   place, \\n\\nshould, however, the Sun in the above position be also associated with a malefic, \\n\\ndeath alone has to be expected.\\n\\n27. If any one of the three Nakshatras mentioned above be thus afflicted by \\n\\nassociation of other malefics (other than the Sun) then death may occur; if with \\n\\nbenefics, there will be no danger to life. Every thing should be judged in the same \\n\\nmanner.\\n\\n28. If the 19th, 10th, 3rd, 1st, 23rd, 5th or 7th (all reckoned from the Janma \\n\\nNakshatra) are afflicted by malefics during their transit, there will be danger to life. \\n\\nIf the planet be benefic, failure in undertaking will be the only result.\\n\\nNotes — For Adhana, Karmaksha, Vainisika etc. see Jataka Parijata (p. 625) \\n\\npublished by Ranjan Publishers.\\n\\n29. If the three Nakshatras viz, the 1st, the 10th and the 19th happen to \\n\\ncoincide with the Sun\\'s entry into a new sign, or with the transit  of any other \\n\\nplanets from one sign to another, or with an eclipse, planetary war, or a fall of \\n\\nmeteors or any other unexpected occurence, there will be likelihood of death of the \\n\\nnative or he will face some similar disaster.\\n\\n252\\n\\n\\x0c30. The planets fail to assert their full effects in the course of their transit in \\n\\nthe following circumstances :—\\n\\n(a)  If a planet  yielding adverse effects is aspected by a benefic, his evil \\n\\neffects are cancelled.\\n\\n(b) A benefic planet is deprived of his benefical effects if he is aspected by a \\n\\nmalefic.\\n\\n(c) A planet loses his capability to do good If he is aspected by an Inimical \\n\\nplanet or planets.\\n\\n31. If a planet in the course of his transit Is placed in an evil house identical \\n\\nwith his own or exalted sign, does not yield adverse effects. If he be placed in an \\n\\nauspicious house identical with his own sign or exalted sign, full beneficial results \\n\\nmay be expected from him.\\n\\n32. Favourable planets if in the course of their transh are placed in their sign \\n\\nof debilitation, or in an inimical or be eclipsed by the Sun\\'s rays lose their power to \\n\\nproduce good effects. If the planets in the above circumstances get placed in an \\n\\nevil house, they yield very adverse effects.\\n\\n33. If the Sun, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn happen to occupy, in the course of \\n\\ntheir transit, the 1st, 8th or 10th house reckoned from the Moon sign, they cause \\n\\ndanger to the life of the native, fall from position and loss of wealth.\\n\\n34. In the course of their transit, the Moon in the 8th, Mars in the 7th, Rahu \\n\\nin the 9th, Mercury in the 4th, Jupiter in the 3rd, Venus in the 6th, Saturn in the 1st \\n\\nand the Sun in the 5th, from the natal Moon, cause loss of honour and wealth, and \\n\\ndanger to life.\\n\\nPlanets and Limbs\\n\\nIn   the   following   six   verses,   the   author   describes   how   the   27   nakshatras \\n\\nreckoned from the Janma Nakshatra (birth star) are distributed among the various \\n\\nparts of the body of the native during the course of the transit of each of the planets \\n\\nfrom the Sun onwards. Their effects have also been mentioned.\\n\\n35. The following table shows the distribution of the 27 nakshatras reckoned \\n\\nfrom the Janma Nakshatra and the relative effects in the course of the transit of the \\n\\n253\\n\\n\\x0cSun:—\\n\\nDistribution amongst births\\n(a) 1st star - face\\n(b) 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th - head\\n(c) 6th, 7th, 8th and 9th - chest\\n(d) 10th, llth, 12th and 13th - right hand\\n(e) 14th, 15th, 16th, 17th, 18th and 19th - \\ntwo feet\\nillness\\n(f) 20th, 21st, 22nd and 23rd - left hand\\ngain of wealth\\n(g) 24th and 25th - the two eyes\\n(h) 26th and 27th - the generative organs danger to life\\n\\nEffects\\ndestruction.\\ngain of wealth.\\nsuccess\\nfinancial gain\\nloss of wealth\\n\\n36.

The   planets   who   in   the   course   ot   their   transits   pass   through   signs \\n\\ncontaining more benefic dots (Bindhus) in the Ashtakavarga, always produce good \\n\\neffects, even when such signs happen to be the 6th, 8th or 12th. Effects of Latta \\n\\nand Sarvatobhadra\\n\\n42-44. In finding out the transit effects at any particular time-(a) The 12th \\n\\nnakshatra from the nakshatra occupied by the Sun,\\n\\n(b) the 3rd nakshatra from the nakshatra occupied by Mars,\\n\\n(c) the 6th nakshatra from the nakshatra occupied by Jupiter, and\\n\\n(d) the 8th nakshatra from that occupied by Saturn, are called lattas.\\n\\n(a) the 5th nakshatra from that occupied by Venus,\\n\\n(b) the 7th from that occupied by Mercury,\\n\\n(c) the 8th from that occupied by Rahu, and\\n\\n(d) the 22nd from that occupied by the Moon\\n\\nare   called   Prushtalatta   or   rear   lattas.   If   when   thus   counting   the   Janma \\n\\nNakshatra happens to come as the Latta star, the native will suffer from illness and \\n\\n255\\n\\n\\x0cmental anxiety.\\n\\n45-46. During the Sun\\'s Latta there will be financial loss in every venture. \\n\\nThere will be grief and unhappiness during the Latta of Rahu. There will be death \\n\\nof the native, destruction of kinsmen and fear during the Latta of Jupiter. Quarrels \\n\\nwill take place during the Latta of Venus. Loss of position may be expected during \\n\\nthe Latta of Mercury. The native will suffer excessive financial loss during the \\n\\nLatta of the Moon.\\n\\n47.   When   two   or   more   Lattas   synchromise,   the   total   effects   will \\n\\nproportionately increase in intensity being twice or thrice. Only evil effects may be \\n\\nexpected as the outcome of such combination.\\n\\n48. The Vedhas pronounced as auspicious in the Sarvatobhadra Chakra bring \\n\\nhappiness while those declared as evil produce only misery. This should also be \\n\\ntaken into account while essessing the, transit effects of a planet.\\n\\nNotes— Mantreshwara makes of the Lattas and Sarvatobhadra Chakra as \\n\\nboth having a bearing on the Vedhas.\\n\\nThe Lattas are of two kinds\\n\\n(1) Forward or puro Lattas and (2) Rear or Prishta Lattas. The Lattas of the \\n\\nSun, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn belong to the former clan. The rest belong to the \\n\\nlatter.\\n\\nThus, if the Sun should occupy at any time, say the nakshatra Moola, his \\n\\nLatta nakshatra (which is the 12th from Moola) will be krittika. Suppose at that \\n\\ntime Venus occupies Sravana, his Latta nakshatra which is the 5th from Sravana \\n\\nwill be Jyestha, the counting in this case being made from Sravana in the reverse \\n\\norder as Venus is a Prishta Latta.\\n\\nSarvatobhadra Chakra\\n\\nShri V. Subrahmania Sastri in his English translation of Phaladeepika has \\n\\ngiven extracts from Horaratna on Sarvatobhadra Chakra which we take the liberty \\n\\nof reproducing for the benefit of the readers.\\n\\n\"Draw ten lines verticalry and other ten lines cross wise over the same. You \\n\\nwill have 81 squares. Which in regular order the 16 vowels from onwards in the \\n\\n256\\n\\n\\x0ccorner squares commencing from the outer most corner in the North-East, thus \\n\\nfilling up in rotation the 4 corners of each of the 4 sets of squares. Fill up the 28 \\n\\nvacant squares of the outermost comer beginning from the North-East by the 28 \\n\\nasterism with krittika, so that each side will contain 7 asterism.\\n\\nThe 5 vacant squares of each side of the next row may be filled by a, ba, ka, \\n\\nha, da in the East, by ma, da, pa, ra, ta in the South, na, ya, ma, ja, kha in the West \\n\\nand na, sa, ta, ca, la in the North. There now remain 12 squares, 3 on each side in \\n\\nthe next Inner row. These may be allotted to the 12 signs beginning with Vrishabha \\n\\nin the East in regular order.\\n\\nThe 5 inner squares still remaining Vacant may be allotted to the 5 groups of \\n\\nTithy * Nanda, Bhadra, Jaya, Rikta and Purna as shown in the chakra.\\n\\nThe seven week days may be entered in the squares thus : Tuesday and \\n\\nSunday in the square containing the Nanda group, Wednesday and Monday in the \\n\\nBhadra group; Thursday in the Jaya group; Friday in the Rikta and Saturday in the \\n\\nPurna.\\n\\nSaturn, the Sun, Rahu, Ketu and Mars are malefics. The rest are benefic. \\n\\nMercury is malefic wher associated with malefics, so also is the waning Moon.\\n\\nIn whichever aslant a planet may be posited, three Vedhas arise from the \\n\\nsame by its aspect - one in the left, one in the first and on in the right.\\n\\nIn the two sides whether in the right or left, the Vedha may be with a star, a \\n\\nconsonant, a Rasi or Vowel and not with others. For, it has been clearly stated in \\n\\nthe Rajavijaya thus :\\n\\nA planet posited in Krittika may have Vedha with the following viz., (1) \\n\\nBharani, (2) the Vowel (3) Vrishabna, (4) Nanda, (5) Bhadra. (6) Tula,  (7) the \\n\\nconsonant (8) Visakha and Sravana.\\n\\nSimilarly a planet in Rohini will have Vedha with (1) the Vowel (2) Aswini, \\n\\n(3) the consonant (4) Mithuna, (5) the Vowel (6) Kanya, (7) the consonant (8) \\n\\n257\\n\\n\\x0cSwati and Abhijit.\\n\\nIn the same way a planet quartered in Mrigasira may have Vedha with (1) \\n\\nKataka (2) the consonant (3) Simha, (4) the consonant (5) Chittra, (6) Revati, (7) \\n\\nthe consonant (8) the Vowel (...) and (9) Uttarashada.\\n\\nWhen a planet is retrograde in motion, the aspect is towards the right. It is \\n\\non the left when the motion is direct (swift). When it is mean one, it is towards the \\n\\nfront. This is with reierence to the five planets from Mars onwards.\\n\\nIn the case of Rahu and Ketu which are always retrograde the Vedha will be \\n\\non the right and in the case of the Sun and the Moon which move direct and have \\n\\nno retrograde motion, the Vedha will be on the left.\\n\\nOwing to there being no uniformity in motion among the other planets, three \\n\\nkinds of vedhas have been mentioned. Malefics when retrograde will cause intense \\n\\nevil if they are in Vedha position, while benefics will do immense good. Malefics \\n\\nand benefics which in rapid motion partake of the nature of the planets they are \\n\\nassociated   with,   when   the   four   asterism   Ardra,   Hasta   Poorvashada   and \\n\\nUttarabhadrapaha which occupy the four central position of the outer most border \\n\\nare passed over (transitted) by a planet the following four triplets viz. (1) (...) (2) \\n\\n(...) (3) (...) and (4) (...) are respectively hit (have Vedhas).\\n\\nIn the case of the pairs (1) (...) (2) (...) (3) (...) and (4) (...) if one letter of any \\n\\npair be hit (has Vedha), the other\\'should also be considered as hit. A Saumya Vedha \\n\\nis one that is caused by a benefic.\\n\\nIf there be Vedha in one of the pairs if similar vowels, the other vowel of the \\n\\npair should also be considered as hit. The same should be made in the case of the \\n\\nAnuswara and Visarga (vowels).\\n\\nWhen a planet in transit is in the last or the first quarter of two asterisms \\n\\n(forming the juncture) in any four comers of the square, there is Vedha of the four \\n\\nvowels,   (...)   and   Purna   tithi   in   regular   order   commencing   with   that   vowel \\n\\nintervening at the particular juncture occupied by the planet, the effects arising \\n\\nfrom these are: agitation or excitement from the first, fear from the second, loss \\n\\nfrom the third and disease from the fourth and death for the fifth.\\n\\n258\\n\\n\\x0cWhen the Vedha Is with an asterism, there is confusion, when with a letter, \\n\\nloss, with a vowel, sickness, and a very great obstacle when with a Tithi or Rasi.\\n\\nWhen there are five Vedhas simultaneously, the individual will not live. A \\n\\nsingle Vedha will engender fear in battle, two vedhas, loss of money, three some \\n\\nobstacle and four death.\\n\\nJust as malefics produce evil and benefics eause good, benefics associated \\n\\nwith malefics produce only evil effects.\\n\\nIn   the   Sun\\'s   Vedha,   there   is   misunderstanding,   in   that   of   Mars,   loss   of \\n\\nwealth;   that   of   Saturn   trouble   through   sickness;   in   those   of   Rahu   and   Ketu, \\n\\nobstacles.   In   the   Moon\\'s   there   will   be   mixed   effects,   in   that   of  Venus,   sexual \\n\\nenjoyment; in that of Mercury, intelligence; in that of Jupiter, all round good effect. \\n\\nWhen the planet causing Vedha is retrograde, the effect is two told: it is thrice \\n\\nwhen he is in exaltation;  when the motion is rapid (direct),  the usual (natural) \\n\\neffect; and when in depression, the effect is only half. Any Tithi, Rasi or Amsa or \\n\\nNakshatra   hit   by   a   malefic   should   be   scrupulously   avoided   in   all   auspicious \\n\\nundertakings; a marriage celebrated during a Vedha will not be happy; and any \\n\\njourney undertaken will not prove prosperous; any treatment given to a patient will \\n\\nnot end in cure; and any business started will not be successful. If a Vedha caused \\n\\nby a malefic should occur during the time of sickness, it will culminate in death if \\n\\nthe motion be retrograde. If the motion be direct, the sickness will soon subside. If \\n\\nthere be Vedha caused by a malefic in one\\'s own week day (of birth), the person \\n\\nwill not have peace of mind and he will suffer from mental pain.\\n\\nDuring  the transit  of the  Sun in the  three Rasis Vrishabha,  Mithuna and \\n\\nKataka   in   the   East   (see   chakra)   the   direction   is   considered   as   set   while   the \\n\\nremaining three as existing (or visible).\\n\\nThe vowels (...) in the North-feast should be considered as belonging to the \\n\\nEast, the Vowels (...) in the South-East; to the South (...) to the West, (...) to the \\n\\nNorth.\\n\\nIn the particular direction in which the Sun is staying for three months, all \\n\\nthe asterism, Vowels, Rasis and Tithis in that direction should be deemed as set.\\n\\n259\\n\\n\\x0cWhen an asterism is set and there is Vedha, sickness will be the result. When \\n\\na consonant is set, there is loss; when a Vowel is set, there is sorrow; when a Rasi \\n\\nis set, there is obstacle; when a Tithi is set and there is Vedha, fear will arise. When \\n\\nall the five are in the set direction and there is Vedha, death will surely result.\\n\\nTowards the direction deemed as set journey, fight, discussion, fixing of a \\n\\nnew door or gate for a place and upper storeys should not be undertaken. Any other \\n\\nsimilar auspicious action should not be done. Whoever has his initial letter situated \\n\\nin the set direction should consider himself as destined unfortunate for the time.\\n\\nPeople   whose   initial  letters   are  in  the  set  direction   should  if   they   desire \\n\\nsuccess, show a poetical contest, a fort, a battle (consisting of elephants, horses, \\n\\nchariots, infantry, etc.), in that particular quarter.\\n\\nIn the case of an asterism situated in any of the other \\'risen\\' direction, if there \\n\\nshould be a Vedha, there will be growth. If the Vedha be with a consonant, gain \\n\\nwill be the result; if with a Vowel, there will be happiness; if with a Rasi, there will \\n\\nbe success; if with a Tithi, there is lustre; if with all, a position is secured.\\n\\nWhen there are Vedhas caused by malefics on both the right and left sides \\n\\nwith   consonants,   Tithis,   Vowels,   Rasis   and   asterisms   at   any   time,   the   person \\n\\nconcerned will surely meet with his death.\\n\\nWhen at the time of a malefic Vedha, there is a fateful upagraha (see next \\n\\nthree slokas of this note) synchromising, death is sure to happen to him either \\n\\nthrough sickness or at battle.\\n\\nThe   fifth   star   reckoned   from   the   one   occupied   by   the   Sun   is   termed \\n\\nVidyumukha. The 8th is called Sula and the 14th Sannipata; the 18th is known as \\n\\nKetu and 21st is Ulka; the 23rd is known as Vajraka and 24th is termed Nirghata. \\n\\nThese eight are known as Upagrahas and are recorgnised as causing obstacles to all \\n\\nundertakings when at the time planets transit their respective palces.\\n\\nAscertain   if   there   is   Vedha   with   any   of   the   following   asterisms;   (1) \\n\\nJanmabha, (2) Karma, (3) Adhana, (4) Vinasa, (5) Samudayika, (6) Sanghatika, (7) \\n\\nJati (8) Desa and (9) Abhisheka and predict good or bad effects according as the \\n\\nVedha producer by a benefic or a malefic as the case may be.\\n\\n260\\n\\n\\x0cThe star in which the Moon is at the time of birth of a person is known as \\n\\nJanmabha or Janmarksha. The 10th therefrom is called karmabha or karmarksha. \\n\\nThe 19th is designed as Adhana, the 23rd is termed Vinasana or Vainsasika, the \\n\\n18th star is styled Samudayika, the 16th asterism is known as Sanghatika, the 26th, \\n\\n27th and 28th are known as Jati, Desa and Abhisheka respectively.\\n\\nIf the Janmarksha, the karmarksha and the Vinasarksha be each occupied by \\n\\nmalefic planets, death, sorrow, absence from one\\'s place and quarrel with one\\'s \\n\\nrelations will respectively resuk.\\n\\nWhen   there   is   gala   in   the   Samudayika   Nakshatra,   evil   or   something \\n\\nuntoward   will   arise.   There   will   be   loss   when   the   Vedha   is   in   the   Sanghatika \\n\\nNakshatra. Destruction of the family will be the effect when the Vedha is in Jati or \\n\\nthe 26th star from Janmarksha. In the 28th star, the Vedha will cause imprisonment.\\n\\nWhen the occultation is by a malefic in the asterism known as Desa, the \\n\\nperson concerned will be expelled from his country. But Vedha in the above case \\n\\nbe by benefics, the result will be auspicious. Should the Vedhas with the Upagrahas \\n\\n(see supra) also occur simultaneously, the result will be death and nothing short of \\n\\nthat.\\n\\nWhen at the time of a battle, caused by one, two, three, four or five malefics, \\n\\nthe   corresponding   effects   will   be   fear,   failure,   killing   (bloodshed)   death   and \\n\\nignominy respectively.\\n\\nWhen   the   Moon   happens   to   be   in  Vedha   simultaneously   with   a  Tithi   or \\n\\nNakshatra,   a   Vowel,   a   Rasl   and   consonant   on   any   day,   that   day   will   prove \\n\\nauspicious or otherwise according as the planet causing the Vedha is benefic or \\n\\nmalefic.\\n\\nWhile the use of the Sarvatobhadra Chakra and the light it may throw on the \\n\\nhuman cycle of life on the person concerned has fully been explained previously, \\n\\nthe technique and the pointers to such deductions (of results) have not had full \\n\\nexplanation to make the same handy and useful for easy reference. The same has \\n\\nbeen explained below.\\n\\n261\\n\\n\\x0cThere are 1-2 letters (or sounds) belonging to the 28 asterisms at the rate of \\n\\none   letter   for   each   Nakshatra   Pada.   These   are   mentioned   for   ready   reference. \\n\\nPerson whose name begins with any one of these letters have got a bearing on the \\n\\ncorresponding Nakshatra pada and judged accordingly.\\n\\n49.   If   planets   are   adversely   posited   whether   during   their   transit,   Dasa, \\n\\nAntardasa or Ashtakavarga, it will be necessary to propitiate them by performing \\n\\nvirtuous deeds, observing fasts, prayersprescribed for them, Japa, Shanti, making \\n\\ngifts and doing appropriate adorations.\\n\\n50. The planets are favourable to those who do not commit acts harmful or \\n\\ninjurious to others, who exercises self control and always follow the path and rules \\n\\nof   conduct   laid   down   by   Shastras   and   who   are   always   observing   religions \\n\\ndiscipline.\\n\\nThus ends the twenty sixth chapter on \"Transits of Planets\" in Phaladeepika \\n\\ncomposed by Mantreswara.\\n\\n262\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 27\\n\\nYogas leading to ascetism\\n\\n1.  When   the   lord   of   the   10th   house   in   association   with   four   planets   be \\n\\nposited in a kendra or trikona, the native attains emancipation.\\n\\nHe will also attain emancipation if at the time of his birth, the end of a sign \\n\\nbe rising and the same by owned by a benefic and Jupiter occupies a kendra or \\n\\ntrikona.\\n\\n2. If at the time of birth of a person, four or more planets are posited in a \\n\\nsingle house, he will become an ascetic of the order indicated by the strongest \\n\\namongst the planets. Some of the learneds are of the opinion that if the lord of the \\n\\n10th   house   be   one   amongst   those   plaets,   the   person   will   take   to   the   order   of \\n\\nascetics signified by the lord of the 10th house.\\n\\nNotes   —   According   to   Brihat   Jataka   if   at   birth   four   or   more   planets \\n\\npossessed of strength occupy a single house, the person born will become a Sakya, \\n\\na Jeevika, a Bhikshu, a Vriddha or Guru, a Charakha, a Nigrantha or Vivasa, a \\n\\nVanyasana or vanaprastha, according as Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, the Moon, Venus, \\n\\nSaturn, or the Sun, is the strongest planet of the group. If the strongest planet in \\n\\nquestion be conquered in planetary war by another planet or planets at the time of \\n\\nbirth, the person will relinquish that stage of ascetic life and revert to the previous \\n\\ncondition in life.\\n\\nAccording to Jataka Parijata, Vanaprastha is a religious man engaged in the \\n\\npractice of regorous and devout penance. A Vivasa is a naked ascetic dwelling in \\n\\nhills  and forests.  A Bhikshu  is an  illustrious  ascetic  with  a single staff  for his \\n\\nsymbol engaged ever and anon in the contemplation of the truths of the sacred \\n\\nscriptures. A Charaka is a religious mendicant wandering over many countries. A \\n\\nSakya   is   an   ill-behaved   ascetic   of   the   Buddhist   class.  A  Guru   is   a   celebrated \\n\\nteacher endowed with royal splendour. A Jeevaka is a garrulous and gluttonous \\n\\nmendicant.\\n\\n3. If the  Moon be posited in  the  decanate of Saturn  and be aspected by \\n\\n263\\n\\n\\x0cSaturn   and   Mars,   the   native   will   turn   into   an   ascetic.   If   the   Moon   be   in   the \\n\\nNavamsa of Mars and be receiving the aspect of Saturn the person will take to the \\n\\norder of ascetism signified by Mars.\\n\\n4. If the lord of the sign occupied by the Moon at birth, be aspected only by \\n\\nSaturn, the native will become an ascetic of the particular class indicated by the \\n\\nJanmadeepa. The remarks made above apply here too.\\n\\n5. The Sun will make the native a chief or lord amongst contemplative saints \\n\\nor one who has taken to ascetism. The Moon will make the native an ascetic who is \\n\\ntravelling to various places of pilgrimge. Mars will cause the native to become an \\n\\nascetic   of   the   Buddhist   order   and   an   expert   in   base   spells.   The   influence   of \\n\\nMercury will enable the native to become a medicant with no knowledge of the \\n\\nvarious schools of philosophy. Jupiter will cause the native to become an ascetic of \\n\\nhigh class possessing knowledge of Vedanta philosophy. Venus will cause to make \\n\\nan ascetic who is a hypocrite, outcaste and public dancer. Saturn will produce an \\n\\nascetic who is an outcaste or a heretic.\\n\\n6-7. The Moon is very strong in the Shukla Paksha or bright half of the \\n\\nmonth.  But if the Moon be weak (waning) and be aspected by the lord of the \\n\\nLagna, the native will become a miserable, distressed and wretched ascetic devoid \\n\\nof wealth and company and one who will get his meals with difficulty.\\n\\nIf,  however, in   the  above  yoga,  there  may  exist  a  Rajayoga,  all   the  bad \\n\\neffects will be removed and the native will become a lord of earth initiated into \\n\\nascetism and inclined virtuously, receiving respect and reverence from other kings.\\n\\n8. If four planets including the lord of the 10th be posited in a kendra or \\n\\ntrlkona or three planets be quartered in an auspicious house, the native will seek \\n\\nadmission to the holy order and will become a successful ascetic.\\n\\nIf there be more benefic in amongst the planets mentioned above occupying \\n\\nauspicious houses, the holy order will be one reverred by the great. If it be not so, \\n\\nthe holy order will not command reverence.\\n\\nThus ends the twenty seventh chapter on \"Ascetic Yogas\\' in Phaladeepika  \\n\\ncomposed by Mantreswara.\\n\\n264\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 28\\n\\nConcluding Chapter\\n\\n1-4. In these verses the author enumerates the number of chapters and the \\n\\nsubjects dealt with In them. This information has been given in full detail in the \\n\\nTable of Contents.\\n\\n5-6.   In   these   verses   the   author   pays   obeisance   to   Goddess   Sukun   who \\n\\nbestows on her devotees all that they desire. He says  that he has been able to \\n\\ncomplete   this   work   by   her   grace.   It   has   also   been   mentioned   that   Shri \\n\\nMantreshwara an astrologer and a Brahmin was born in Tirunveli - a district in the \\n\\nsouth   of   present   Tamil   Nadu   State   for   the   enjoyment   and   benefit   of   other \\n\\nastrologers.\\n\\nThus ends the twenty eighths chapter on \"Upasamhara\" in Phaladeepika  \\n\\ncomposed by Mantreswara.\\n\\n265\\n\\n\\x0c')]"
